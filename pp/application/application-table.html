                  these is 128 bits. The evaluators shall also provide a key (of the length 
                  appropriate to the AES algorithm) that is constant throughout the test. The 
                  evaluators then invoke the <a class="abbr" href="#abbr_TSF"><abbr title="TOE Security Functionality">TSF</abbr></a> RBG 10,000 times, with the DT 
                  value being incremented by 1 on each iteration, and the new seed for the 
                  subsequent iteration produced as specified in NIST-Recommended Random Number 
                  Generator Based on ANSI X9.31 Appendix A.2.4 Using the 3-Key Triple DES and AES 
                  Algorithms, Section E.3. The evaluators ensure that the 10,000th value produced 
                  matches the expected value.

<b>Test 1: </b>
                  The evaluator shall perform 15 trials for the RNG implementation. If the RNG is
                  configurable, the evaluator shall perform 15 trials for each configuration. The
                  evaluator shall also confirm that the operational guidance contains appropriate
                  instructions for configuring the RNG functionality.
                  <br>
                  If the RNG has prediction resistance enabled, each trial consists of (1) 
                  instantiate DRBG, (2) generate the first block of random bits (3) generate a 
                  second block of random bits (4) uninstantiate. The evaluator verifies that the 
                  second block of random bits is the expected value. The evaluator shall generate 
                  eight input values for each trial. The first is a count (0 – 14). The next three 
                  are entropy input, nonce, and personalization string for the instantiate 
                  operation. The next two are additional input and entropy input for the first call 
                  to generate. The final two are additional input and entropy input for the second
                  call to generate. These values are randomly generated. “generate one block of 
                  random bits” means to generate random bits with number of returned bits equal to 
                  the Output Block Length (as defined in NIST SP 800-90A).
                  <br>
                  If the RNG does not have prediction resistance, each trial consists of (1) 
                  instantiate DRBG, (2) generate the first block of random bits (3) reseed, (4) 
                  generate a second block of random bits (5) uninstantiate. The evaluator verifies 
                  that the second block of random bits is the expected value. The evaluator shall 
                  generate eight input values for each trial. The first is a count (0 – 14). The 
                  next three are entropy input, nonce, and personalization string for the 
                  instantiate operation. The fifth value is additional input to the first call to
                  generate. The sixth and seventh are additional input and entropy input to the call 
                  to reseed. The final value is additional input to the second generate call.
                  <br>
                  The following paragraphs contain more information on some of the input values to 
                  be generated/selected by the evaluator.
                  <br>
                  <b>Entropy input:</b> the length of the entropy input value must equal the seed length.
                  <br>
                  <b>Nonce:</b> If a nonce is supported (CTR_DRBG with no Derivation Function does not use 
                  a nonce), the nonce bit length is one-half the seed length. 
                  <br>
                  <b>Personalization string:</b> The length of the personalization string must be 
                  less then or equal to seed length. If the implementation only supports one 
                  personalization string length, then the same length can be used for both values. 
                  If more than one string length is support, the evaluator shall use personalization 
                  strings of two different lengths. If the implementation does not use a 
                  personalization string, no value needs to be supplied. 
                  <br>
                  <b>Additional input:</b> the additional input bit lengths have the same defaults 
                  and restrictions as the personalization string lengths.

              For each supported NIST curve, i.e., P-256, P-384 and P-521, the evaluator shall
              generate 10 private/public key pairs using the key generation function of a known 
              good implementation and modify five of the public key values so that they are 
              incorrect, leaving five values unchanged (i.e., correct). The evaluator shall obtain 
              in response a set of 10 PASS/FAIL values.

              <b>Key Generation for Finite-Field Cryptography (FFC)</b><p></p>
              The evaluator shall verify the implementation of the Parameters Generation and the 
              Key Generation for FFC by the <a xmlns:htm="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="abbr" href="#abbr_TOE"><abbr title="Target of Evaluation">TOE</abbr></a> using the Parameter Generation and 
              Key Generation test. This test verifies the ability of the <a xmlns:htm="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="abbr" href="#abbr_TSF"><abbr title="TOE Security Functionality">TSF</abbr></a> to 
              correctly produce values for the field prime p, the cryptographic prime q (dividing 
              p-1), the cryptographic group generator g, and the calculation of the private key x 
              and public key y. The Parameter generation specifies 2 ways (or methods) to generate 
              the cryptographic prime q and the field prime p:
	      </p>
	      <p>
	      Cryptographic and Field Primes:

              </ul>
              and two ways to generate the cryptographic group generator g:

              </ul>
              The Key generation specifies 2 ways to generate the private key x:
              Private Key:
              <ul>
                <li>len(q) bit output of RBG where 1 ≤x ≤ q-1</li>
                <li>len(q) + 64 bit output of RBG, followed by a mod q-1 operation where 
              1≤ x≤q-1.</li>
              </ul>
              The security strength of the RBG must be at least that of the security offered by the 
              FFC parameter set.
              To test the cryptographic and field prime generation method for the provable primes 
              method and/or the group generator g for a verifiable process, the evaluator must seed 
              the <a xmlns:htm="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="abbr" href="#abbr_TSF"><abbr title="TOE Security Functionality">TSF</abbr></a> parameter generation routine with sufficient data to

              The evaluator shall verify a TOE's implementation of SP800-56A key agreement schemes 
              using the following Function and Validity tests. These validation tests for each key agreement 
              scheme verify that a TOE has implemented the components of the key agreement scheme 
              according to the specifications in the Recommendation. These components include the 
              calculation of the DLC primitives (the shared secret value Z) and the calculation of the 
              derived keying material (DKM) via the Key Derivation Function (KDF). If key confirmation 
              is supported, the evaluator shall also verify that the components of key confirmation have 
              been implemented correctly, using the test procedures described below. This includes the 
              parsing of the DKM, the generation of MACdata and the calculation of MACtag.
              <br><br>
              
		      <b>Function Test</b><p></p>
                The Function test verifies the ability of the TOE to implement the key agreement 
                schemes correctly. To conduct this test the evaluator shall generate or obtain test vectors 
                from a known good implementation of the TOE supported schemes. For each supported 
                key agreement scheme-key agreement role combination, KDF type, and, if supported, 
                key confirmation role- key confirmation type combination, the tester shall generate 10 
                sets of test vectors. The data set consists of one set of domain parameter values (FFC) or 
                the NIST approved curve (ECC) per 10 sets of public keys. These keys are static, 
                ephemeral or both depending on the scheme being tested.
                <br>
                The evaluator shall obtain the DKM, the corresponding TOE’s public keys (static and/or 
                ephemeral), the MAC tag(s), and any inputs used in the KDF, such as the Other 
                Information <i>(OtherInfo)</i> and TOE id fields.
                <br>
                If the TOE does not use a KDF defined in SP 800-56A, the evaluator shall obtain only 
                the public keys and the hashed value of the shared secret.
                <br>
                The evaluator shall verify the correctness of the TSF’s implementation of a given 
                scheme by using a known good implementation to calculate the shared secret value, 
                derive the keying material DKM, and compare hashes or MAC tags generated from 
                these values.
                <br>
                If key confirmation is supported, the TSF shall perform the above for each implemented 
                approved MAC algorithm.
                <br><br>
                <b>Validity Test</b><p></p>
                The Validity test verifies the ability of the TOE to recognize another party’s valid and 
                invalid key agreement results with or without key confirmation. To conduct this test, the 
                evaluator shall obtain a list of the supporting cryptographic functions included in the 
                SP800-56A key agreement implementation to determine which errors the TOE should 
                be able to recognize. The evaluator generates a set of 24 (FFC) or 30 (ECC) test vectors 
                consisting of data sets including domain parameter values or NIST approved curves, the 
                evaluator’s public keys, the TOE’s public/private key pairs, MACTag, and any inputs 
                used in the KDF, such as the OtherInfo and TOE id fields.
                <br>
                The evaluator shall inject an error in some of the test vectors to test that the TOE 
                recognizes invalid key agreement results caused by the following fields being incorrect: 
                the shared secret value Z, the DKM, the OtherInfo field, the data to be 
                MACed, or the generated MACTag. If the TOE contains the full or partial (only ECC) 
                public key validation, the evaluator will also individually inject errors in both parties’ 
                static public keys, both parties’ ephemeral public keys and the TOE’s static private key 
                to assure the TOE detects errors in the public key validation function and/or the partial 
                key validation function (in ECC only). At least two of the test vectors shall remain 
                unmodified and therefore should result in valid key agreement results (they should 
                pass).
                <br>
                The TOE shall use these modified test vectors to emulate the key agreement scheme 
                using the corresponding parameters. The evaluator shall compare the TOE’s results with 
                the results using a known good implementation verifying that the TOE detects these 
                errors.

              The evaluator shall verify that the TSS describes whether the TOE acts as a sender, a 
              recipient, or both for RSA-based key establishment schemes.
              <br>
              If the TOE acts as a sender, the following evaluation activity shall be performed to ensure the 
              proper operation of every TOE supported combination of RSA-based key establishment 
              scheme:
              <br>
              
                To conduct this test the evaluator shall generate or obtain test vectors from a known 
                good implementation of the TOE supported schemes. For each combination of 
                supported key establishment scheme and its options (with or without key confirmation 
                if supported, for each supported key confirmation MAC function if key confirmation 
                is supported, and for each supported mask generation function if KTS-OAEP is 
                supported), the tester shall generate 10 sets of test vectors. Each test vector shall 
                include the RSA public key, the plaintext keying material, any additional input 
                parameters if applicable, the MacKey and MacTag if key confirmation is 
                incorporated, and the outputted ciphertext. For each test vector, the evaluator shall 
                perform a key establishment encryption operation on the TOE with the same inputs 
                (in cases where key confirmation is incorporated, the test shall use the MacKey from 
                the test vector instead of the randomly generated MacKey used in normal operation) 
                and ensure that the outputted ciphertext is equivalent to the ciphertext in the test 
                vector.

                confirmation if supported, for each supported key confirmation MAC function if key 
                confirmation is supported, and for each supported mask generation function if KTS-OAEP is 
                supported), the tester shall generate 10 sets of test vectors. Each test vector 
                shall include the RSA private key, the plaintext keying material (KeyData), any 
                additional input parameters if applicable, the MacTag in cases where key 
                confirmation is incorporated, and the outputted ciphertext. For each test vector, the 
                evaluator shall perform the key establishment decryption operation on the TOE and 
                ensure that the outputted plaintext keying material (KeyData) is equivalent to the 
                plaintext keying material in the test vector. In cases where key confirmation is 
                incorporated, the evaluator shall perform the key confirmation steps and ensure that 
                the outputted MacTag is equivalent to the MacTag in the test vector.

              The evaluator shall ensure that the TSS describes how the TOE handles decryption errors. In 
              accordance with NIST Special Publication 800-56B, the TOE must not reveal the particular 
              error that occurred, either through the contents of any outputted or logged error message or 
              through timing variations. If KTS-OAEP is supported, the evaluator shall create separate 
              contrived ciphertext values that trigger each of the three decryption error checks described in 
              NIST Special Publication 800-56B section 7.2.2.3, ensure that each decryption attempt 
              results in an error, and ensure that any outputted or logged error message is identical for each. 
              If KTS-KEM-KWS is supported, the evaluator shall create separate contrived ciphertext

              <b>AES-CBC Known Answer Tests</b>
              <p></p>There are four Known Answer Tests (KATs), described below. In
              all KATs, the plaintext, ciphertext, and IV values shall be 128-bit
              blocks. The results from each test may either be obtained by the

              by submitting the same inputs to a known good implementation. 
              <ul>
                <li>KAT-1. To test the encrypt functionality of AES-CBC, the
                evaluator shall supply a set of 10 plaintext values and obtain
                the ciphertext value that results from AES-CBC encryption of the
                given plaintext using a key value of all zeros and an IV of all

                all-zeros key, and the other five shall be encrypted with a
                256-bit all- zeros key. To test the decrypt functionality of

                all-zeros plaintext using the given key value and an IV of all
                zeros. Five of the keys shall be 128-bit keys, and the other five

                of an all-zeros plaintext using the given key value and an IV of
                all zeros. The first set of keys shall have 128 128-bit keys, and
                the second set shall have 256 256-bit keys. Key i in each set

                key value of all zeros with an IV of all zeros, respectively.
                Plaintext value i in each set shall have the leftmost i bits be

                [1,128].</li>
              </ul>To test the decrypt functionality of AES-CBC, the evaluator
              shall perform the same test as for encrypt, using ciphertext values
              of the same form as the plaintext in the encrypt test as input and

              <p></p>The evaluator shall test the encrypt functionality by
              encrypting an i-block message where 1 &lt; i &lt;= 10. The
              evaluator shall choose a key, an IV and plaintext message of length
              i blocks and encrypt the message, using the mode to be tested, with
              the chosen key and IV. The ciphertext shall be compared to the
              result of encrypting the same plaintext message with the same key
              and IV using a known good implementation. The evaluator shall also
              test the decrypt functionality for each mode by decrypting an
              i-block message where 1 &lt; i &lt;=10. The evaluator shall choose
              a key, an IV and a ciphertext message of length i blocks and
              decrypt the message, using the mode to be tested, with the chosen
              key and IV. The plaintext shall be compared to the result of
              decrypting the same ciphertext message with the same key and IV
              using a known good implementation. AES-CBC Monte Carlo Tests The
              evaluator shall test the encrypt functionality using a set of 200
              plaintext, IV, and key 3- tuples. 100 of these shall use 128 bit
              keys, and 100 shall use 256 bit keys. The plaintext and IV values
              shall be 128-bit blocks. For each 3-tuple, 1000 iterations shall be
              run as follows: 
              <pre>
              # Input: PT, IV, Key
              for i = 1 to 1000:
                if i == 1:
                      CT[1] = AES-CBC-Encrypt(Key, IV, PT)
                      PT = IV
                else:
                  CT[i] = AES-CBC-Encrypt(Key, PT) 
                  PT = CT[i-1]
              </pre>The ciphertext computed in the 1000th iteration (i.e.,
              CT[1000]) is the result for that trial. This result shall be
              compared to the result of running 1000 iterations with the same
              values using a known good implementation.
              <br>The evaluator shall test the decrypt functionality using the
              same test as for encrypt, exchanging CT and PT and replacing
              AES-CBC-Encrypt with AES-CBC-Decrypt. 
              <br>
              <b>AES-GCM Monte Carlo Tests</b>

                <li>128 bit and 256 bit keys</li>
                <li>Two plaintext lengths. One of the plaintext lengths shall be
                a non-zero integer multiple of 128 bits, if
                supported. The other plaintext length shall not be an integer
                multiple of 128 bits, if supported.</li>

                One AAD length shall be a non-zero integer
                multiple of 128 bits, if supported. One AAD length shall not be

              </ul>The evaluator shall test the encrypt functionality using a set
              of 10 key, plaintext, AAD, and IV tuples for each combination of
              parameter lengths above and obtain the ciphertext value and tag
              that results from AES-GCM authenticated encrypt. Each supported tag
              length shall be tested at least once per set of 10. The IV value
              may be supplied by the evaluator or the implementation being
              tested, as long as it is known. 
              <br>The evaluator shall test the decrypt functionality using a
              set of 10 key, ciphertext, tag, AAD, and IV 5-tuples for each
              combination of parameter lengths above and obtain a Pass/Fail
              result on authentication and the decrypted plaintext if Pass. The
              set shall include five tuples that Pass and five that Fail. 
              <br>The results from each test may either be obtained by the
              evaluator directly or by supplying the inputs to the implementer
              and receiving the results in response. To determine correctness,
              the evaluator shall compare the resulting values to those obtained

	<br>
	256 bit (for AES-128) and 512 bit (for AES-256) keys
	<br><br>Three data unit (i.e., plaintext) lengths. One of the data unit lengths shall be a
	non-zero integer multiple of 128 bits, if supported. One of the data unit lengths
	shall be an integer multiple of 128 bits, if supported. The third data unit length
	shall be either the longest supported data unit length or 216 bits, whichever is
	smaller.
	<br><br>Using a set of 100 (key, plaintext and 128-bit random tweak value) 3-tuples and

                the TLS package is included in the ST, the hashing algorithms selection for FCS_COP.1(2)
                must match the hashing algorithms used in the mandatory and selected cipher suites of
                the TLS package. Vendors are strongly encouraged to implement updated protocols that
              	support the SHA-2 family; until updated protocols are supported, this PP allows support for
              	SHA-1 implementations in compliance with SP 800-131A.
              	<br>
              	The intent of this requirement is to specify the hashing function. The hash selection must
              	support the message digest size selection. The hash selection should be consistent with the
              	overall strength of the algorithm used (for example, SHA 256 for 128-bit keys).

            length. As there are different tests for each mode, an indication is given in the 
            following sections for the bit-oriented vs. the byte-oriented testmacs. The evaluator

			  On some platforms, the application must explicitly solicit permission

			  Seeking such permissions, even if the application does not later make use of the
			  hardware resource, should still be considered access.
			  Selections should be expressed in a manner consistent with how the application expresses
			  its access needs to the underlying platform.  For example,
			  the platform may provide <i>location services</i> which implies the potential use of a variety
			  of hardware resources (e.g. satellite receivers, WiFi, cellular radio)
			  yet <i>location services</i> is the proper selection.  This is because use of these resources
			  can be inferred, but also because the actual usage may vary based on the particular platform.
              Resources that do not need to be explicitly identified are
              those which are ordinarily used by any application such as central processing units,

              aspects of the system, including any application crashes during testing. The evaluator
              shall determine the root cause of any application crashes and include that information
              in the report. The test plan covers all of the testing actions contained in
              the  and the body of this PP’s evaluation activities. 
              <br>
              While it
              is not necessary to have one test case per test listed in an evaluation activity, the
              evaluator must document in the test plan that each applicable testing requirement in
              the <a xmlns:htm="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="abbr" href="#abbr_ST"><abbr title="Security Target">ST</abbr></a> is covered. The test plan identifies the platforms to be tested, and for those
              platforms not included in the test plan but included in the <a xmlns:htm="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="abbr" href="#abbr_ST"><abbr title="Security Target">ST</abbr></a>, the test plan provides
              a justification for not testing the platforms. This justification must address the
              differences between the tested platforms and the untested platforms, and make an
              argument that the differences do not affect the testing to be performed. It is not
              sufficient to merely assert that the differences have no effect; rationale must be
              provided. If all platforms claimed in the <a xmlns:htm="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="abbr" href="#abbr_ST"><abbr title="Security Target">ST</abbr></a> are tested, then no rationale is
              necessary. The test plan describes the composition of each platform to be tested, and
              any setup that is necessary beyond what is contained in the AGD documentation. It
              should be noted that the evaluator is expected to follow the AGD documentation for
              installation and setup of each platform either as part of a test or as a standard
              pre-test condition. This may include special test drivers or tools. For each driver or
              tool, an argument (not just an assertion) should be provided that the driver or tool
              will not adversely affect the performance of the functionality by the <a xmlns:htm="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="abbr" href="#abbr_TOE"><abbr title="Target of Evaluation">TOE</abbr></a> and its platform. 
              <br>
              This also includes the configuration of the
              cryptographic engine to be used. The cryptographic algorithms implemented by this
              engine are those specified by this PP and used by the cryptographic protocols being
              evaluated (e.g SSH). The test plan identifies high-level test objectives
              as well as the test procedures to be followed to achieve those objectives. These
              procedures include expected results. 
              <br>
              The test report (which could just be an annotated
              version of the test plan) details the activities that took place when the test
              procedures were executed, and includes the actual results of the tests. This shall be
              a cumulative account, so if there was a test run that resulted in a failure; a fix
              installed; and then a successful re-run of the test, the report would show a “fail”
              and “pass” result (and the supporting details), and not just the “pass”
              result.</td>
