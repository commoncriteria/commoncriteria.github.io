    PP-Module for Wireless Local Area Network (WLAN) Access System is
    to describe the security functionality of 
      Wireless Local Area Network (WLAN) Access System products in terms of 
    [CC] and to define functional and assurance requirements for them.

    
    The PP-Module is intended for use with the following Base-PP:
        <ul><li><a href="">collaborative 
    Protection Profile for NDs, Version 2.2e</a></li></ul><br/>
    This SD is mandatory for evaluations of TOEs that claim conformance to a PP-Configuration that includes the PP-Module for :
    <ul><li>Wireless Local Area Network (WLAN) Access System, Version 1.0</li></ul>
    As such it defines Evaluation Activities for the functionality described in the PP-Module as well as any impacts to the Evaluation Activities to the Base-PP(s) it modifies.
    </p><p> 
Although Evaluation Activities are defined mainly for the evaluators to follow, in general they also help developers to prepare for evaluation by identifying specific requirements for their TOE.
    The specific requirements in Evaluation Activities may in some cases clarify the meaning of Security
    Functional Requirements (SFR), and may identify particular requirements for the content of Security
    Targets (ST) (especially the TOE Summary Specification), user guidance documentation, and possibly
    supplementary information (e.g. for entropy analysis or cryptographic key management architecture).</p><h2 id="structure" class="indexable" data-level="1">1.2 Structure of the Document</h2><p>Evaluation Activities can be defined for both SFRs and Security Assurance Requirements (SAR),
    which are themselves defined in separate sections of the SD.</p><p>If any Evaluation Activity cannot be successfully completed in an evaluation, then
    the overall verdict for the evaluation is a 'fail'.
    In rare cases there may be acceptable reasons why an Evaluation Activity
    may be modified or deemed not applicable for a particular TOE, 
    but this must be approved by the Certification Body for the evaluation.</p><p>In general, if all Evaluation Activities (for both SFRs and SARs) are successfully
    completed in an evaluation then it would be expected that the overall verdict for 
    the evaluation is a ‘pass’.
    To reach a ‘fail’ verdict when the Evaluation Activities have been successfully 
    completed would require a specific justification from the evaluator as to why the 
    Evaluation Activities were not sufficient for that TOE.
    </p><p>Similarly, at the more granular level of assurance components, if the Evaluation 
    Activities for an assurance component and all of its related SFR Evaluation 
    Activities are successfully completed in an evaluation then it would be expected 
    that the verdict for the assurance component is a ‘pass’.
    To reach a ‘fail’ verdict for the assurance component when these Evaluation 
    Activities have been successfully completed would require a specific justification 
    from the evaluator as to why the Evaluation Activities were not sufficient for that TOE.

</table><h1 id="sfr" class="indexable" data-level="0">2 Evaluation Activities for SFRs</h1><p>The EAs presented in this section capture the actions the evaluator performs 
    to address technology specific aspects covering specific SARs (e.g. ASE_TSS.1, 
    ADV_FSP.1, AGD_OPE.1, and ATE_IND.1) – this is in addition to the CEM workunits 
    that are performed in Section <a href="#sar_aas" class="dynref">3 Evaluation Activities for SARs</a>.</p><p>Regarding design descriptions (designated by the subsections labeled TSS, as 
    well as any required supplementary material that may be treated as proprietary), 
    the evaluator must ensure there is specific information that satisfies the EA. 
    For findings regarding the TSS section, the evaluator’s verdicts will be 
    associated with the CEM workunit ASE_TSS.1-1.
    Evaluator verdicts associated with the supplementary evidence will also be 
    associated with ASE_TSS.1-1, 
    since the requirement to provide such evidence is specified in ASE in the PP.</p><p>For ensuring the guidance documentation provides sufficient information for 
    the administrators/users as it pertains to SFRs, the evaluator’s verdicts will 
    be associated with CEM workunits ADV_FSP.1-7, AGD_OPE.1-4, and AGD_OPE.1-5.</p><p>Finally, the subsection labeled Tests is where the authors have determined 
    that testing of the product in the context of the associated SFR is necessary.
    While the evaluator is expected to develop tests, there may be instances where 
    it is more practical for the developer to construct tests, or where the 
    developer may have existing tests. 
    Therefore, it is acceptable for the evaluator to witness developer-generated 
    tests in lieu of executing the tests. 
    In this case, the evaluator must ensure the developer’s tests are executing both 
    in the manner declared by the developer and as mandated by the EA. 
    The CEM workunits that are associated with the EAs specified in this section 
    are: ATE_IND.1-3, ATE_IND.1-4, ATE_IND.1-5, ATE_IND.1-6, and ATE_IND.1-7.</p><h2 class="indexable" data-level="1" id="aa-ND">2.1 collaborative

		    In this case, the evaluator shall ensure that these are the only supported lengths.
                    To test the generation-encryption functionality of AES-CCM, the evaluator shall

		  The evaluator shall perform the following test using a packet sniffing tool to collect

		  The evaluator shall examine the operational guidance to determine that it provides guidance to
                administrators on the composition of strong text-based pre-shared keys, and (if the selection indicates
                keys of various lengths can be entered) that it provides information on the range of lengths supported.
                The guidance must specify the allowable characters for pre-shared keys, and that list must be a superset of the list contained in FIA_PSK_EXT.1.2.</p>
		<p>
                
                The evaluator shall confirm the operational guidance contains instructions for either entering bit-based
                pre-shared keys for each protocol identified in the requirement, or generating a bit-based pre-shared
                key (or both).
		</p>
	      <div class="eacategory">Tests</div>The evaluator shall also perform the following tests for each protocol (or instantiation of a protocol, if
                performed by a different implementation on the TOE). Note that one or more of these tests can be
                performed with a single test case.
                <ul>
                  <li><b>Test 1: </b>The evaluator shall compose a pre-shared key of 22 characters that contains a combination of
                    the allowed characters in accordance with the operational guidance, and demonstrates that a successful
                    protocol negotiation can be performed with the key.
                  </li>
                  <li><b>Test 2: </b>[conditional]: If the TOE supports pre-shared keys of multiple lengths, the evaluator shall repeat
                    Test 1 using the minimum length; the maximum length; a length inside the allowable range; and invalid
                    lengths beyond the supported range (both higher and lower). The minimum, maximum, and included
                    length tests should be successful, and the invalid lengths must be rejected by the TOE.
                  </li>
                  <li><b>Test 3: </b>[conditional]: If the TOE does not generate bit-based pre-shared keys, the evaluator shall obtain a
                    bit-based pre-shared key of the appropriate length and enter it according to the instructions in the
                    operational guidance. The evaluator shall then demonstrate that a successful protocol negotiation can
                    be performed with the key.</li>
                  <li><b>Test 4: </b>[conditional]: If the TOE does generate bit-based pre-shared keys, the evaluator shall generate a
                    bit-based pre-shared key of the appropriate length and use it according to the instructions in the
                    operational guidance. The evaluator shall then demonstrate that a successful protocol negotiation can
                    be performed with the key.

	base NDcPP to which it must claim conformance.
	It is important to note that a TOE that is evaluated against the PP-Module is
	inherently evaluated against this Base-PP as well. 
	The NDcPP 
        includes a number of Evaluation Activities associated with both SFRs and SARs.
	Additionally, the PP-Module includes a number of SFR-based Evaluation Activities 
	that similarly refine the SARs of the Base-PPs.
	The evaluation laboratory will evaluate the TOE against the Base-PP
      
    and supplement that evaluation with the necessary SFRs that are taken from the PP-Module.
