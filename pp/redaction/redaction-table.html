              a visible element, and whether the element was selected by the user or removed

<b>Application Note: </b>The report can be a configurable feature that is only generated

              instructions for the configuration of the reporting feature in accordance with this
              requirement. The evaluator shall create test files with specific elements to redact,

<b>Application Note: </b> Structural data is extraneous if it is unnecessary for the

              the document.<br xmlns="http://common-criteria.rhcloud.com/ns/cc"></br> Example - many formats include comments, e.g. PDF allows file
              format comments which are preceded by %. When these comments are unnecessary,
              unrelated to the printing or display of the content of the document, or provide no
              functionality whatsoever they must be removed.<br xmlns="http://common-criteria.rhcloud.com/ns/cc"></br> Example – some formats expect a
              header structure starting at the first byte of a file, but a tool may be able to
              interpret a file where the header starts at a later byte by ignoring the data that
              precedes the header structure. In this case, the preceding data must be removed since
              it is unexpected. </div>

<td>The evaluator shall create or acquire test files that contain unrecognized
              data, unexpected data, and extraneous structural data. The evaluator shall examine the

<td><description xmlns="http://common-criteria.rhcloud.com/ns/cc">To test the <span title="Target of Evaluation">TOE</span>, the evaluator
              will have to use test documents that have content expected to produce a certain
              result. The evaluator will apply the redaction tool to the test files and examine the
              output to determine if it is as expected. The same test documents can be used for each
                <span title="Target of Evaluation">TOE</span> that produces the same format as those
              test documents. For example, a set of PDF test files can be used for all PDF redaction
              tools. Test files will usually contain only one testable item at a time to make it
              easier to identify that item in the structure of the document, but some test files
              should contain multiple testable items. The Technical Community will create a set of
              test files for the assurance activities for the most common formats. </description></td>
