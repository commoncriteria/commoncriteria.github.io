		<!-- This section sets the context for not only the ESR, but what is 
			expected of the resulting Protection Profile (PP). The intent is 
			that the remaining sections provide succinct statements that 
			highlight the relevant aspects to be addressed by the Technical 
			Community (TC) constructing the PP. Here, the authors provide a 
			narrative that introduces the reader to the problem being solved, 
			and presents key aspects that support or guide the TC, and may
			elaborate on subtleties not apparent in the “bulleted” high level
			statements.

			identifying the resources to be protected, and what threats must be
			considered in the drafting of the Essential Security Requirements

		<!--
        	This is where the authors present an initial set of English 
        	requirements that specify security functionality, rather than 
        	design and/or implementation characteristics. These requirements 
        	will provide the foundation for which the detailed set of 
        	requirements is derived. It is important that the requirements 
        	captured here make an attempt to fully address the categories 
        	(e.g., access control, identification and authentication, 
        	management capabilities, roles of administration, secure 
        	communications, and audit). That's not to say the requirements are 
        	fully specified or detailed enough to simply translate to Common 
        	Criteria security functional requirements. The goal is that there 
        	is enough information contained here, as well as the other sections
        	of this document, to provide the TC enough information to ensure 
        	they have an understanding of what is minimally required in breath.

			functions or capabilities that would require assurance activities 
			that are too subjective, or specific expertise not available in the
			evaluation facilities expected to assess products against the PP
