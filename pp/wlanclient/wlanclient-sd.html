    to describe the security functionality of 
      PP-Module for Wireless LAN Clients products in terms of 
    [CC] and to define functional and assurance requirements for them.
    The PP-Module is intended for use with the following Base-PPs:
        <ul><li><a href="https://www.niap-ccevs.org/Profile/Info.cfm?PPID=442&amp;id=442">
    Protection Profile for General Purpose Operating Systemss, Version 4.2.1</a></li><li><a href="https://www.niap-ccevs.org/Profile/Info.cfm?PPID=417&amp;id=417">
    Protection Profile for Mobile Device Fundamentalss, Version 3.1</a></li></ul></p><p>This SD is mandatory for evaluations of TOEs that claim conformance to a PP-Configuration that includes the PP-Module for :
    <ul><li>WLAN Clients, Version 1.0</li></ul>
    As such it defines Evaluation Activities for the functionality described in the PP-Module as well as any impacts to the Evaluation Activites to the Base-PP(s) it modifies.
   </p><p> 
Although Evaluation Activities are defined mainly for the evaluators to follow, in general they also help developers to prepare for evaluation by identifying specific requirements for their TOE.
    The specific requirements in Evaluation Activities may in some cases clarify the meaning of Security
    Functional Requirements (SFR), and may identify particular requirements for the content of Security
    Targets (ST) (especially the TOE Summary Specification), user guidance documentation, and possibly
    supplementary information (e.g. for entropy analysis or cryptographic key management architecture).</p><h2 data-level="1" class="indexable" id="structure">1.2 Structure of the Document</h2><p>Evaluation Activities can be defined for both SFRs and Security Assurance Requirements (SAR),
    which are themselves defined in separate sections of the SD.</p><p>If any Evaluation Activity cannot be successfully completed in an evaluation, then
    the overall verdict for the evaluation is a 'fail'.
    In rare cases there may be acceptable reasons why an Evaluation Activity
    may be modified or deemed not applicable for a particular TOE, 
    but this must be approved by the Certification Body for the evaluation.</p><p>In general, if all Evaluation Activities (for both SFRs and SARs) are successfully
    completed in an evaluation then it would be expected that the overall verdict for 
    the evaluation is a ‘pass’.
    To reach a ‘fail’ verdict when the Evaluation Activities have been successfully 
    completed would require a specific justification from the evaluator as to why the 
    Evaluation Activities were not sufficient for that TOE.
    </p><p>Similarly, at the more granular level of assurance components, if the Evaluation 
    Activities for an assurance component and all of its related SFR Evaluation 
    Activities are successfully completed in an evaluation then it would be expected 
    that the verdict for the assurance component is a ‘pass’.
    To reach a ‘fail’ verdict for the assurance component when these Evaluation 
    Activities have been successfully completed would require a specific justification 
    from the evaluator as to why the Evaluation Activities were not sufficient for that TOE.

    to address technology specific aspects covering specific SARs (e.g. ASE_TSS.1, 
    ADV_FSP.1, AGD_OPE.1, and ATE_IND.1) – this is in addition to the CEM work units 
    that are performed in Section <a href="#sar_aas" class="dynref"> 6 Evaluation Activities for SARs</a>.</p><p>Regarding design descriptions (designated by the subsections labelled TSS, as 
    well as any required supplementary material that may be treated as proprietary), 
    the evaluator must ensure there is specific information that satisfies the EA. 
    For findings regarding the TSS section, the evaluator’s verdicts will be 
    associated with the CEM work unit ASE_TSS.1-1.
    Evaluator verdicts associated with the supplementary evidence will also be 
    associated with ASE_TSS.1-1, 
    since the requirement to provide such evidence is specified in ASE in the PP.</p><p>For ensuring the guidance documentation provides sufficient information for 
    the administrators/users as it pertains to SFRs, the evaluator’s verdicts will 
    be associated with CEM work units ADV_FSP.1-7, AGD_OPE.1-4, and AGD_OPE.1-5.</p><p>Finally, the subsection labelled Tests is where the authors have determined 
    that testing of the product in the context of the associated SFR is necessary.
    While the evaluator is expected to develop tests, there may be instances where 
    it is more practical for the developer to construct tests, or where the 
    developer may have existing tests. 
    Therefore, it is acceptable for the evaluator to witness developer-generated 
    tests in lieu of executing the tests. 
    In this case, the evaluator must ensure the developer’s tests are executing both 
    in the manner declared by the developer and as mandated by the EA. 
    The CEM work units that are associated with the EAs specified in this section 
    are: ATE_IND.1-3, ATE_IND.1-4, ATE_IND.1-5, ATE_IND.1-6, and ATE_IND.1-7.</p><h2 data-level="1" class="indexable" id="aa-$GPOS">2.1

                If "invoke platform-provided functionality" is selected, the evaluator shall examine the <a href="#abbr_TSS" class="abbr"><abbr title="TOE Summary Specification">TSS</abbr></a> to verify it describes (for each supported platform) how this functionality is invoked 
                (it should be noted that this may be through a mechanism that is not implemented by the WLAN Client; however, that mechanism will be identified in the <a href="#abbr_TSS" class="abbr"><abbr title="TOE Summary Specification">TSS</abbr></a> as part of this evaluation activity).<p></p>

                The evaluator shall check the operational guidance and ensure it lists all of the auditable
                events and provides a format for audit records. Each audit record format type must be
                covered, along with a brief description of each field. The evaluator shall check to make sure
                that every audit event type mandated by the PP-Module is described and that the description of the
                fields contains the information required in FAU_GEN.1.2/WLAN, and the additional information
                specified in the Auditable Events table.
                <p></p>
                The evaluator shall in particular ensure that the operational guidance is clear in relation to the
                contents for failed cryptographic events. In the Auditable Events table, information detailing the cryptographic
                mode of operation and a name or identifier for the object being encrypted is required. The
                evaluator shall ensure that name or identifier is sufficient to allow an administrator reviewing
                the audit log to determine the context of the cryptographic operation (for example,
                performed during a key negotiation exchange, performed when encrypting data for transit) as
                well as the non-TOE endpoint of the connection for cryptographic failures relating to
                communications with other IT systems.
                <p></p>
                The evaluator shall also make a determination of the administrative actions that are relevant
                in the context of this PP-Module. The TOE may contain functionality that is not evaluated in the
                context of this PP-Module because the functionality is not specified in an SFR. This functionality may
                have administrative aspects that are described in the operational guidance. Since such
                administrative actions will not be performed in an evaluated configuration of the TOE, the
                evaluator shall examine the operational guidance and make a determination of which
                administrative commands, including subcommands, scripts, and configuration files, are related
                to the configuration (including enabling or disabling) of the mechanisms implemented in the
                TOE that are necessary to enforce the requirements specified in the PP-Module, which thus form the
                set of “all administrative actions”. The evaluator may perform this activity as part of the

                The evaluator shall test the TOE’s ability to correctly generate audit records by having the TOE
                generate audit records in accordance with the assurance activities associated with the
                functional requirements in this PP-Module. When verifying the test results, the evaluator shall ensure
                the audit records generated during testing match the format specified in the administrative
                guide, and that the fields in each audit record have the proper entries.
                <p></p>               
                Note that the testing here can be accomplished in conjunction with the testing of the security
                mechanisms directly. For example, testing performed to ensure that the administrative
                guidance provided is correct verifies that AGD_OPE.1 is satisfied and should address the
                invocation of the administrative actions that are needed to verify the audit records are
                generated as expected.

                <ul>
                  <li><b>Test 1: </b>
                    The evaluator shall configure the access point so the cryptoperiod of the
                    session key is 1 hour. The evaluator shall successfully connect the TOE to the access
                    point and maintain the connection for a length of time that is greater than the
                    configured cryptoperiod. The evaluator shall use a packet capture tool to determine
                    that after the configured cryptoperiod, a re-negotiation is initiated to establish a new
                    session key. Finally, the evaluator shall determine that the renegotiation has been 
                    successful and the client continues communication with the access point.
                  </li>
                  <li><b>Test 2: </b>The evaluator shall perform the following test using a packet sniffing tool to
                    collect frames between the TOE and a wireless LAN access point:
                    <p></p>
                    Step 1: The evaluator shall configure the access point to an unused channel and
                    configure the WLAN sniffer to sniff only on that channel (i.e., lock the sniffer on the
                    selected channel). The sniffer should also be configured to filter on the MAC address
                    of the TOE and/or access point.
                    <p></p>
                    Step 2: The evaluator shall configure the TOE to communicate with a WLAN access
                    point using IEEE 802.11-2016 and a 256-bit (64 hex values 0-f) pre-shared key. The
                    pre-shared key is only used for testing.
                    <p></p>
                    Step 3: The evaluator shall start the sniffing tool, initiate a connection between the
                    TOE and the access point, and allow the TOE to authenticate, associate, and
                    successfully complete the 4-way handshake with the client.
                    <p></p>
                    Step 4: The evaluator shall set a timer for 1 minute, at the end of which the evaluator
                    shall disconnect the TOE from the wireless network and stop the sniffer.
                    <p></p>
                    Step 5: The evaluator shall identify the 4-way handshake frames (denoted EAPOL-key
                    in Wireshark captures) and derive the PTK from the 4-way handshake frames and preshared key as specified in IEEE 802.11-2016.
                    <p></p>
                    Step 6: The evaluator shall select the first data frame from the captured packets that
                    was sent between the TOE and access point after the 4-way handshake successfully
                    completed, and without the frame control value 0x4208 (the first 2 bytes are 08 42).
                    The evaluator shall use the PTK to decrypt the data portion of the packet as specified
                    in IEEE 802.11-2016, and shall verify that the decrypted data contains ASCII-readable
                    text.
                    <p></p>

              The evaluator shall perform the following test using a packet sniffing tool to collect frames
              between the TOE and a wireless access point (which may be performed in conjunction with the
              assurance activity for FCS_CKM.1.1/WLAN).
              <p></p> 
              Step 1: The evaluator shall configure the access point to an unused channel and configure the
              WLAN sniffer to sniff only on that channel (i.e., lock the sniffer on the selected channel). The
              sniffer should also be configured to filter on the MAC address of the TOE and/or access point.
              <p></p>

              Step 3: The evaluator shall start the sniffing tool, initiate a connection between the TOE and
              access point, and allow the TOE to authenticate, associate, and successfully complete the 4-way
              handshake with the TOE.

              Step 4: The evaluator shall set a timer for 1 minute, at the end of which the evaluator shall
              disconnect the TOE from the access point and stop the sniffer.
              <p></p> 
              Step 5: The evaluator shall identify the 4-way handshake frames (denoted EAPOL-key in
              Wireshark captures) and derive the PTK and GTK from the 4-way handshake frames and preshared key as specified in IEEE 802.11-2016.
              <p></p> 
              Step 6: The evaluator shall select the first data frame from the captured packets that was sent
              between the TOE and access point after the 4-way handshake successfully completed, and with
              the frame control value 0x4208 (the first 2 bytes are 08 42). The evaluator shall use the GTK to

              that the decrypted data contains ASCII-readable text.
              <p></p>

                <li><b>Test 1: </b>The evaluator shall establish a TLS connection using each of the cipher suites
                  specified by the requirement. This connection may be established as part of the
                  establishment of a higher-level protocol, e.g., as part of an EAP session. It is sufficient to
                  observe the successful negotiation of a cipher suite to satisfy the intent of the test; it is
                  not necessary to examine the characteristics of the encrypted traffic in an attempt to
                  discern the cipher suite being used (for example, that the cryptographic algorithm is 128-bit
                  AES and not 256-bit AES).
                </li>
                <li><b>Test 2: </b>
                  The evaluator shall attempt to establish the connection using a server with a
                  server certificate that contains the Server Authentication purpose in the
                  extendedKeyUsage field and verify that a connection is established. The evaluator will
                  then verify that the client rejects an otherwise valid server certificate that lacks the
                  Server Authentication purpose in the extendedKeyUsage field and a connection is not
                  established. Ideally, the two certificates should be identical except for the
                  extendedKeyUsage field.

                <li><b>Test 3: </b>
                  The evaluator shall send a server certificate in the TLS connection that does not
                  match the server-selected cipher suite (for example, send a ECDSA certificate while using
                  the TLS_RSA_WITH_AES_128_CBC_SHA cipher suite or send a RSA certificate while using
                  one of the ECDSA cipher suites.) The evaluator shall verify that the TOE disconnects after
                  receiving the server’s Certificate handshake message.

                      message (if using a DHE or ECDHE cipher suite) or that the server denies the
                      client’s Finished handshake message.</li>

                      to be a cipher suite not presented in the Client Hello handshake message. The
                      evaluator shall verify that the client rejects the connection after receiving the
