    PP-Module for Wireless Intrusion Detection/Prevention Systems (WIDS/WIPS) is
    to describe the security functionality of 
      Wireless Intrusion Detection/Prevention Systems (WIDS/WIPS) products in terms of 
    [CC] and to define functional and assurance requirements for them.

    
    The PP-Module is intended for use with the following Base-PP:
        <ul><li><a href="">Network Device, version 2.2e</a></li></ul><br/>
    This SD is mandatory for evaluations of TOEs that claim conformance to a PP-Configuration that includes the PP-Module for :
    <ul><li>Wireless Intrusion Detection/Prevention Systems (WIDS/WIPS), Version 1.0</li></ul>
    As such it defines Evaluation Activities for the functionality described in the PP-Module as well as any impacts to the Evaluation Activities to the Base-PP(s) it modifies.
    </p><p> 
Although Evaluation Activities are defined mainly for the evaluators to follow, in general they also help developers to prepare for evaluation by identifying specific requirements for their TOE.
    The specific requirements in Evaluation Activities may in some cases clarify the meaning of Security
    Functional Requirements (SFR), and may identify particular requirements for the content of Security
    Targets (ST) (especially the TOE Summary Specification), user guidance documentation, and possibly
    supplementary information (e.g. for entropy analysis or cryptographic key management architecture).</p><h2 id="structure" class="indexable" data-level="1">1.2 Structure of the Document</h2><p>Evaluation Activities can be defined for both SFRs and Security Assurance Requirements (SAR),
    which are themselves defined in separate sections of the SD.</p><p>If any Evaluation Activity cannot be successfully completed in an evaluation, then
    the overall verdict for the evaluation is a 'fail'.
    In rare cases there may be acceptable reasons why an Evaluation Activity
    may be modified or deemed not applicable for a particular TOE, 
    but this must be approved by the Certification Body for the evaluation.</p><p>In general, if all Evaluation Activities (for both SFRs and SARs) are successfully
    completed in an evaluation then it would be expected that the overall verdict for 
    the evaluation is a ‘pass’.
    To reach a ‘fail’ verdict when the Evaluation Activities have been successfully 
    completed would require a specific justification from the evaluator as to why the 
    Evaluation Activities were not sufficient for that TOE.
    </p><p>Similarly, at the more granular level of assurance components, if the Evaluation 
    Activities for an assurance component and all of its related SFR Evaluation 
    Activities are successfully completed in an evaluation then it would be expected 
    that the verdict for the assurance component is a ‘pass’.
    To reach a ‘fail’ verdict for the assurance component when these Evaluation 
    Activities have been successfully completed would require a specific justification 
    from the evaluator as to why the Evaluation Activities were not sufficient for that TOE.

</table></div><h1 id="sfr" class="indexable" data-level="0">2 Evaluation Activities for SFRs</h1><p>The EAs presented in this section capture the actions the evaluator performs 
    to address technology specific aspects covering specific SARs (e.g. ASE_TSS.1, 
    ADV_FSP.1, AGD_OPE.1, and ATE_IND.1) – this is in addition to the CEM workunits 
    that are performed in Section <a href="#sar_aas" class="dynref">3 Evaluation Activities for SARs</a>.</p><p>Regarding design descriptions (designated by the subsections labeled TSS, as 
    well as any required supplementary material that may be treated as proprietary), 
    the evaluator must ensure there is specific information that satisfies the EA. 
    For findings regarding the TSS section, the evaluator’s verdicts will be 
    associated with the CEM workunit ASE_TSS.1-1.
    Evaluator verdicts associated with the supplementary evidence will also be 
    associated with ASE_TSS.1-1, 
    since the requirement to provide such evidence is specified in ASE in the PP.</p><p>For ensuring the guidance documentation provides sufficient information for 
    the administrators/users as it pertains to SFRs, the evaluator’s verdicts will 
    be associated with CEM workunits ADV_FSP.1-7, AGD_OPE.1-4, and AGD_OPE.1-5.</p><p>Finally, the subsection labeled Tests is where the authors have determined 
    that testing of the product in the context of the associated SFR is necessary.
    While the evaluator is expected to develop tests, there may be instances where 
    it is more practical for the developer to construct tests, or where the 
    developer may have existing tests. 
    Therefore, it is acceptable for the evaluator to witness developer-generated 
    tests in lieu of executing the tests. 
    In this case, the evaluator must ensure the developer’s tests are executing both 
    in the manner declared by the developer and as mandated by the EA. 
    The CEM workunits that are associated with the EAs specified in this section 
    are: ATE_IND.1-3, ATE_IND.1-4, ATE_IND.1-5, ATE_IND.1-6, and ATE_IND.1-7.</p><h2 class="indexable" data-level="1" id="aa-">2.1 Collaborative 
    Protection Profile for Network Device</h2>
      The EAs defined in this section are only applicable in cases where the TOE claims conformance
      to a PP-Configuration that includes the NDcPP.

            This PP-Module mandates the inclusion of this selection-based SFR because a TOE that conforms to this PP-Module will always be deployed in a configuration that requires this SFR to be claimed.
            
              The TSF shall be able to generate audit records for each TOE
                component. The audit records generated by the TSF of each TOE component shall include the
                subset of security relevant audit events which can occur on the TOE component.
              
              This SFR is selection-based in the Base-PP but is mandated by this PP-Module because the ST author must claim a distributed TOE selection in FAU_STG_EXT.1.2.
              
                
                  There is no change to the EAs specified for this SFR in the NDcPP SD. 
                The PP-Module modifies this SFR to make its inclusion mandatory rather than selection-based, but there is no change to how the SFR must be implemented.
                  
              
              
          
          
           
            This PP-Module modifies the Base-PP SFR to remove a selection that is not permitted by the TOE architecture that it specifies.
            
              The TSF shall be able to transmit the generated audit data to an external IT entity using a trusted channel according to FTP_ITC.1.
              
            
            
              
                The TSF shall be able to store generated audit data on the TOE itself. In addition  
                  The TOE shall be a distributed TOE that stores audit data on the following TOE components: identification of TOE components 
                  The TOE shall be a distributed TOE with storage of audit data provided externally for the following TOE components:

              This SFR is modified from its definition in the Base-PP by removing the selection option for the TOE to be standalone. A TOE that conforms to this PP-Module is expected to be distributed.
              There is no change to the EAs specified for this SFR in the NDcPP SD. 
                The PP-Module modifies this SFR to remove one of the possible selection items, but there is no change to how the SFR is to be implemented.
              
              
          
          
        
        
           
            This PP-Module mandates the inclusion of this optional SFR because it is required to implement functionality required by this PP-Module.
            
              
                The TSF shall require a Security Administrator to enable
                communications between any pair of TOE components before such communication can take
                place.
              
            
            
              The TSF shall implement a registration process in which
                components establish and use a communications channel that uses 
                A channel that meets the secure channel requirements in 
                  FTP_ITC.1
                  FPT_ITT.1

              The TSF shall enable a Security Administrator to disable
                communications between any pair of TOE components.
            This SFR is optional in the NDcPP but is mandated by this PP-Module because the WIDS TOE is expected to be a distributed system. 
              There is no change to the EAs specified for this SFR in the NDcPP SD. 
                The PP-Module modifies this SFR to make its inclusion mandatory rather than optional, but there is no change to how the SFR is to be implemented.
              
                
          
        
        
           
            This PP-Module mandates the inclusion of this optional SFR because it is required to implement functionality required by this PP-Module.
            
              The TSF shall protect TSF data from disclosure and detect its
                  modification when it is transmitted between separate parts of the TOE
                  through the use of 
                    IPsec

                  . 
               FPT_ITT.1 is optional in NDcPP, however, since a WIDS/WIPS
                TOE is distributed, FPT_ITT.1 shall be included in the ST and is applicable to the data transmitted between the sensors and
                controller. 
                This requirement ensures all communications between
                components of a distributed TOE is protected through the use of an encrypted
                communications channel. The data passed in this trusted communication channel are
                encrypted as defined in the protocol chosen in the selection. The ST author chooses
                the mechanisms supported by the TOE, and then ensures that the detailed protocol
                requirements in Appendix B of NDcPP corresponding to their selection are included in
                the ST, if not already present. 
              There is no change to the EAs specified for this SFR in the NDcPP SD. 
                The PP-Module modifies this SFR to make its inclusion mandatory rather than optional, but there is no change to how the SFR is to be implemented. 
              
            
          
        
        
           
            This PP-Module refines the Base-PP SFR to add a selection for a specific external entity that may be applicable to a TOE that conforms to this PP-Module.
            
               The TSF shall be capable of using 
                IPsec
                SSH
                TLS

                   to provide a trusted communication channel between itself and
                  authorized IT entities supporting the following capabilities: audit server, 
                    authentication server
                    database server
                    other capabilities
                    no other capabilities
                   that is logically distinct from other communication channels
                and provides assured identification of its end points and protection of the channel
                data from disclosure and detection of modification of the channel data.
              
              This SFR is modified from its definition in the Base-PP by 
                adding a selection for a database server capability. 
                If the TSF uses a separate database server to support its security-relevant functionality, 
                this selection must be included in the ST.
                The intent of the database server is to store WIDS/WIPS data that must
                be queryable, such as events/alarms, triangulation calculations, wireless spectrum analysis (including RF jammer/Denial of Service (DoS)),
                and packet capture analysis. Authorized Administrators must be permitted to view alarms, raw event data, and any other data stored in the database.
                The Administrator must access the database through a trusted channel if done so remotely.
              
                The intent of this requirement is to provide a means by
                which a cryptographic protocol may be used to protect external communications with
                authorized IT entities that the TOE interacts with to perform its functions. The TOE
                uses at least one of the listed protocols for communications with the server that
                collects the audit information.   If
                other authorized IT entities are protected, the ST author makes the appropriate
                assignments (for those entities) and selections (for the protocols that are used to
                protect those connections). The ST author selects the mechanism or mechanisms
                supported by the TOE, and then ensures that the detailed protocol requirements in
                Appendix B of NDcPP corresponding to their selection are included in the ST.
              
               There is no change to the EAs specified for this SFR in the NDcPP SD. 
                If ‘database server’ is selected in FTP_ITC.1.1, the evaluator shall ensure that the required tests are performed on that external interface in addition to the other claimed interfaces.
                The evaluator shall also perform test 4 for this SFR in the NDcPP SD, which is objective in NDcPP.

          This SFR defines operations to be performed on collected WIDS data, which is collected using an external interface defined in this PP-Module that extends the logical scope of the TOE beyond what the Base-PP defines.
          
             The TSF shall display an alert to Authorized Administrator in sufficient
              detail to include identity of APs and EUDs involved, signal strength, accurate event timestamp, description of alert and severity level and
              
                capture raw frame traffic that triggered the violation
                no other actions
               upon detection of a potential security violation.
             If "capture raw frame traffic that triggers the violation" is
              selected then FAU_STG_EXT.1/PCAP must be included in the ST. 
              FAU_SAA.1 defines the rules for monitoring the wireless traffic to detect for potential security violations. 
              FAU_INV_EXT.2 defines the information the TOE needs to collect for all APs and EUDs within range of the the TOE's sensors. Device attributes can then be individually filtered
              and/or selected in order to be displayed as part of the alert.
            
            
               The evaluator shall verify that the TSS describes where to find the WIDS alerts
                on the Administrator console/interface.
              
               The evaluator shall use the operational guidance for instructions on where
                the alerts generated are displayed within the WIDS interface. If "capture raw frame traffic that triggers the violation is selected", the
                evaluator shall use the operational guidance to configure the traffic capture
                capabilities.
              
              
                
                  The evaluator shall perform a series of events or generate traffic that
                    would successfully trigger an alert for each of the rules defined in FAU_SAA.1. The evaluator should verify and record
                    whether the TOE generated the alert for each rule, and provided sufficient details. The evaluator should also record the events
                    or traffic that was generated as each alert was attempted to be triggered and
                    record the details provided by the TOE in the alert. 
                  [conditional] If capturing of raw frames was selected, verify
                    that the packet capture was triggered and stored as appropriate.

                selection to selectively exclude alerts from being generated. 
            
              The evaluator shall verify that the TSS describes the ability of the TOE to filter 
                WIDS/WIPS alerts.
              
               The evaluator shall verify that the operational guidance includes

                        alert. 
                      The evaluator shall disable the alert. The evaluator shall then generate

             The auditable events defined in 
              are for the SFRs that are explicitly defined in this PP-Module and are intended to
              extend FAU_GEN.1 in the Base-PP. The events in the Auditable Events table should
              be combined with those of the NDcPP in the context of a conforming Security
              Target. The Auditable Events () includes
              optional and objective SFRs. The auditing of optional and objective SFRs is only
              required if that SFR is included in the ST.  Per FAU_STG_EXT.1 in the
              Base-PP, the TOE must support transfer of the audit data to an external IT entity
              using a trusted channel. 
          
          
             The TSF shall record within each audit record at least the following
              information: 
                Date and time of the event, type of event, and subject identity (if
                  applicable);
                For each audit event type, based on the auditable event definitions of the
                  functional components included in the PP/ST, [auditable events listed in
                    Auditable Events table ()]. 
              
            
             The subject identity in this case is the allowlisted inventory
              item. 
            
               There are no TSS evaluation activities for this SFR.
              
               There are no operational guidance activities for this SFR.
              
               The evaluator shall test the TOE’s ability to correctly generate audit records
                by having the TOE generate audit records in accordance with the evaluation activities
                associated with the functional requirements in this PP-Module. When verifying the
                test results, the evaluator shall ensure the audit records generated during testing
                match the format specified in the administrative guide, and that the fields in each
                audit record have the proper entries.  Note that the testing here can
                be accomplished in conjunction with the testing of the security mechanisms directly.
              
            
          
        

        
          This family defines requirements for supported methods of intrusion detection.
        
        
          This SFR defines operations to be performed on collected WIDS data, which is collected using an external interface defined in this PP-Module that extends the logical scope of the TOE beyond what the Base-PP defines.
          requires the TSF to specify the methods of intrusion detection that it supports.
          No specific management functions are identified.
          There are no auditable events foreseen.
          No dependencies.
          
             The TSF shall provide the following methods of intrusion detection 
                anomaly-based
                signature-based
                other detection method
              . 
             At least one detection method must be selected. If multiple
              detection methods are supported, each supported method must be selected.
               If anomaly-based detection is selected, then FAU_ANO_EXT.1 shall be
              included in the ST. If signature-based detection is selected, then FAU_SIG_EXT.1 shall
              be included in the ST.
            
            
               The evaluator shall verify that the TSS includes which intrusion detection
                method(s) the TOE utilizes. If multiple methods are selected, the evaluator shall
                confirm that the TSS describes how the different methods are
                incorporated.
              
               The evaluator shall verify that the operational guidance provides
                instructions on how to configure the TOE in order for it to detect such

          This family defines requirements for detection and inventorying of network assets in the TOE’s operational environment.
        
        
          This SFR defines operations to be performed on assets in the TOE’s operational environment, which is behavior defined in this PP-Module that extends the logical scope of the TOE beyond what the Base-PP defines.
          requires the TSF to determine if inventoried objects are authorized or unauthorized.
          The following actions could be considered for the management functions in FMT: 
            Definition of inventory of authorized APs based on MAC address
            Definition of inventory of authorized EUDs based on MAC address

              This inventory is used as an allowlist to indicate to the WIDS which APs and EUDs are authorized members of the wireless network. The inventory of authorized APs and EUDs is configured by FMT_SMF.1/WIDS.  
              The terminology used to describe an inventoried or allowlisted device may vary by vendor
              product. This PP-Module utilizes allowlisted to describe APs and EUDs that are part of
              the inventory and non-allowlisted to describe APs and EUDs that are not part of the
              inventory.

                EUDs and APs is presented by the TOE. The evaluator shall verify that the TSS
                includes where in the WIDS interface the list of detected APs and EUDs is
                displayed.

                        for an AP and EUD to the allowlist.
                      Deploy the AP and EUD that were added to allowlist within the range of
                        the TOE's sensors.
                      Verify that the devices are classified as authorized.
                      Remove the EUD from the allowlist.
                      Verify that the EUD is classified as unauthorized.

                      Verify that the list of detected APs and EUDs contains the allowlisted
                        AP and EUD that were just deployed. 
                      If the AP and EUD are detected verify that they are classified as
                        allowlisted devices.

                  Detection of allowlisted EUD or AP that is using weak/outdated WLAN protocols and protocol implementations:
                    
                          Deploy an allowlisted AP that utilizes the 802.11g or older WLAN protocol.
                          Verify that the TSF detects the weak/outdated WLAN protocol and generates an alert.
                    
                    
                  
                  Detection of extremely high numbers of client devices using a particular allowlisted AP:                   
                    
                          Deploy an allowlisted AP.
                          Configure a threshold amount of client devices that can use a particular AP.
                          Connect enough client devices to the AP to purposely exceed the defined threshold.
                          Verify that the TSF detects when the client usage exceeds the threshold.
                    
                    
                  
                  Detection of a high number of failed attempts to join the WLAN in a short period of time:
                    
                          Deploy an allowlisted AP.
                          Configure a threshold amount of connection attempts that can occur in a particular timeframe.
                          Attempt to authenticate to the AP with enough client devices to purposely exceed the defined threshold.
                          Verify that the TSF detects when the connection attempts within the specic timeframe exceeds the threshold.
                    
                    
                  
                  Detection of the use of active WLAN scanners (e.g. wardriving tools) to generate WLAN traffic:
                    
                          Deploy an allowlisted AP.
                          Verify that the TSF detects when WLAN scanners are the source of WLAN traffic.
                    
                    
                  
                  Detection of the physical location of an identified WLAN threat by using triangulation:
                    
                          Deploy a non-allowlisted AP or EUD within range of the TSF.
                          Verify that the TSF can track and locate the AP or EUD to within 5 meters.
                    
                    
                  
                  Detection of an SSID using weak/unsupported/disallowed encryption options:
                    
                          Deploy an allowlisted AP and configure its encryption options.
                          Change the encryption options the AP advertises.
                          Verify that the TSF detects when the AP's encryption options change.
                    
                    
                  
                  Detection of AP SSID larger than 32 bytes:
                    
                          Deploy an allowlisted AP and configure its SSID to be larger than 32 bytes.
                          Configure a user defined signature on the WIDS to detect when an SSID is larger than 32 bytes.
                          Verify that the TSF detects when the AP's SSID is larger than 32 bytes.
                    
                    
                  
                  
                  
                
              
            
          
        
        
          This family defines requirements for data collection of potentially malicious wireless network activity.
        
         
          This SFR defines operations to be performed on assets in the TOE’s operational environment, which is behavior defined in this PP-Module that extends the logical scope of the TOE beyond what the Base-PP defines.
          requires the TSF to implement a mechanism to distinguish between authorized and unauthorized network assets.
          The following actions could be considered for the management functions in FMT: 
            Definition of authorized SSID(s)
            Definition of authorized WLAN authentication schemes
            Definition of authorized WLAN encryption schemes
            Definition of authorized WLAN traffic schemes 
          
          
          
            The following actions should be auditable if FAU_GEN Security Audit Data Generation is included in the PP/ST:
              Detection of rogue AP or EUD
              Detection of unauthorized SSID
            
          
          FAU_INV_EXT.1 Environmental Inventory
          
             The TSF shall distinguish between benign and malicious APs and EUDs based on if the APs and EUDs are authorized and 
              automatic detection metrics
              no other method
            .
             
              FAU_INV_EXT.1 defines that an AP or EUD is authorized based on if the AP/EUD is allowlisted as configured in FMT_SMF.1. 
              A non-allowlisted device does not always have to be conducting malicious activity. 
              However, it is acceptable to equate an allowlisted AP/EUD as both authorized/benign and a nonallowlisted AP/EUD as both not authorized and thus malicious. 
              If the TOE supports automatic malicious device detection, based on in-depth network traffic analysis, "automatic detection metrics" must be selected. 
              This can be used to further distinguish if the AP/EUD is benign or malicious. If the TOE does not support automatic detection metrics, "no other method" must be selected.
            
          
          
             The TSF shall provide the ability to determine if a given SSID is authorized. 
             FMT_SMF.1/WIDS defines the subset of authorized SSID(s). 
            
               The evaluator shall verify that the TSS describes how the TOE detects malicious
                APs/EUDs and whether the TOE supports automatic detection. The evaluator shall
                verify that the TSS includes how the TOE determines if a given SSID is authorized.
                
              
               If TOE supports automatic detection, the evaluator shall
                verify that the operational guidance contains instructions for configuring the
                automatic detection metrics. The evaluator shall verify that the operational guidance
                provides instructions on how to configure SSIDs as authorized.
              
              
                               
                  For test 1 and 2 below the evaluator shall verify that the TOE detects and appropriately classifies the APs and EUDs. It is acceptable if the TOE uses different but equivalent descriptors for the classification. If the TOE does not support automatic detection metrics and equates a non-allowlisted AP/EUD as malicious, than it is sufficient that the the classification given to the AP/EUD in step 1 is the same as in step 2. If the TOE supports automatic detection metrics and distinguishes between a non-allowlisted AP/EUD and a malicious AP/EUD, then the classification for the AP/EUD should differ between step 1 and step 2.
                                        
                      
                        
                          Deploy a non-allowlisted AP in the area of the WIDS sensor, but take no action against the network. Verify that the AP is classified as non-authorized.
                          Deploy a non-allowlisted AP in the area of the WIDS sensor and launch an attack against the network. This can be any variation of Fake AP, Spoof AP, Flood or DoS attack. 
                          Verify that the AP is classified as malicious.
                        
                      
                      
                        
                          Deploy a non-allowlisted EUD in the area of the WIDS sensor, but take no action against the network. Verify that the EUD is classified as non-authorized.
                          Launch an RF Flooding, DoD/DDoS, masqueraded or spoofing attack against authorized AP with an unauthorized EUD. 
                          Verify that the EUD is classified as malicious.                        
                        
                      
                      
                        
                          Deploy an AP with an unauthorized SSID in the area of the WIDS sensor.
                          Verify that the TOE detects the unauthorized SSID.
                        
                      
                    
                  
                
              
            
          
        
 
        
          This SFR defines operations to be performed on assets in the TOE’s operational environment, which is behavior defined in this PP-Module that extends the logical scope of the TOE beyond what the Base-PP defines.
          requires the TSF to surveil certain wireless frequency bands and perform stateful inspection of traffic on them.
          The following actions could be considered for the management functions in FMT: 
            Definition of authorized and unauthorized TCP/IP and UDP traffic
            Definition of known malicious activity ports
            Definition of the amount of time that a sensor monitors a specific frequency or channel
          
          
          
            The following actions should be auditable if FAU_GEN Security Audit Data Generation is included in the PP/ST: 
            Sensor wireless transmission capabilities
            
          
          No dependencies.
          
             The TSF shall 
                simultaneously
                nonsimultaneously
               monitor and analyze network traffic matching the 802.11 monitoring SFP
              for all channels in the following RF frequencies: 
                2.4 GHz
                5.0 GHz
                6.0 GHz
               and
              
                specified Wi-Fi channels in the 4.9 GHz regulatory domain
                channels outside regulatory domain
                non-standard channel frequencies
                no other domains
              . 
             
              If "nonsimultaneously" is selected, then "Define the amount of
              time sensor monitors a specific channel" must be selected in FMT_SMF.1/WIDS.
               The "802.11 monitoring SFP" is a security function policy and the SFRs
              that reference this policy describe what the policy does. The "802.11 monitoring SFP"
              is established in FDP_IFC.1 and defined through FAU_WID_EXT.1, FAU_WID_EXT.2,
              in addition to optional SFRs
              FAU_WID_EXT.3 and FAU_WID_EXT.4. A vendor does not have to formally define this
              policy, it only needs to comply with the SFRs.
          
          
             The TSF shall provide wireless sensors to detect network traffic matching the
              802.11 monitoring SFP that 
                can be configured to prevent transmission of data
                does not transmit data
              . 
             
              If "can be configured to prevent transmission of data" is
              selected then "Enable/Disable transmission of data by wireless sensor" must be
              selected in FMT_SMF.1/WIDS.  
              The intent of this SFR is to employ WIDS
              sensors that can have all wireless transmission capabilities disabled for instances
              where a site wishes to implement a no wireless policy.   
              The "802.11 monitoring SFP" is a security function policy and the SFRs that reference this policy describe
              what the policy does. The "802.11 monitoring SFP" is established in FDP_IFC.1 and
              defined through FAU_WID_EXT.1, FAU_WID_EXT.2, in addition to optional SFRs FAU_WID_EXT.3 and FAU_WID_EXT.4. A vendor
              does not have to formally define this policy, it only needs to comply with the SFRs.
            
          
          
             The TSF shall perform stateful frame inspection and log attacks spanning
              multiple frames. 
             
              Attackers possess the capability to distribute an attack
              across multiple frames in an attempt to avoid traditional detection measures that
              solely focus on packet headers. Stateful frame inspection will allow for the
              identification of obfuscation techniques centered around spreading an attack across
              multiple frames.
            
               
                The evaluator shall verify that the TSS includes which channels the TOE can
                detect and monitor. Additionally, the TSS shall include whether the TOE
                simultaneously or nonsimultaneously monitors network traffic across these channels.
                The evaluator shall verify that the TSS includes information on if the sensors are
                completely passive, by default, or if the sensors ability to transmit data is
                configurable. 
              
               
                The evaluator shall review the operational guidance for how to configure
                the TOE to monitor the channels as selected in the SFR. If the sensor ability to
                transmits data is configurable, the evaluator shall review the operational guidance
                for how to disable wireless transmissions from the sensor. The evaluator shall verify that the operational guidance provides
                instructions on how to specify and confirm that stateful frame capture and
                inspection is being performed.

                      Deploy AP on at least 2 different channels within the regulatory domain
                        on 2.4 GHz band.
                      Deploy AP on at least 2 different channels outside the regulatory domain
                        on 2.4 GHz band.
                      Verify that the AP gets detected on each channel tested.

                    Deploy AP and set to channels within the 4.9 GHz band outlined in the TSS.
                    Verify that the AP gets detected on each channel tested.
                  
                  
                   Channels on 6 GHz band (if selected)
                    Configure the TSF to monitor the channels specified in the SFR.
                    Deploy AP and set to channels within the 6 GHz band outlined in the TSS.
                    Verify that the AP gets detected on each channel tested.

                Wireless Sensor Transmission of Data 
                If the TOE provides the ability to disable wireless transmission, the evaluator shall follow the operational guidance to configure the sensor to not transmit wirelessly. The evaluator shall then deploy a signal analyzer in order to check for wireless emanations from the TOE.  
                Repeat the two tests below, for both the 2.4 GHz, 5 GHz, and 6 GHz band. 
                
                  
                    
                      Boot a sensor and using the signal analyzer observe to check if any
                        eminations are coming from the sensor.
                      Verify that the signal analyzer does not pick up emanations from the
                        sensor.
                    
                  
                  
                    
                      During normal sensor operations, observe the analyzer for about 10
                        minutes to check if any eminations are coming from the sensor.
                      Verify that the signal analyzer does not pick up emanations from the
                        sensor.

          This SFR iterates the FMT_SMF.1 SFR defined in the Base-PP to define management functions for the functionality that is specific to this PP-Module.
          
             The TSF shall be capable of performing the following management functions for WIDS functionality: 
              
                Define an inventory of authorized APs based on 
                  MAC addresses
                  other unique device identifier
                ,
                Define an inventory of authorized EUDs based on MAC addresses,
                Define rules for monitoring and alerting on the wireless traffic,
                Define authorized SSID(s),
                Define authorized WLAN authentication schemes,
                Define authorized WLAN encryption schemes,
                
                
                
                    Specify periods of network activity that constitute baseline of expected behavior
                    Define anomaly activity
                    Define classification rules to detect rogue APs
                    
                        enable
                        disable
                       transmission of data by wireless sensor
                    Define attack signatures
                    Define rules for overwriting previous packet captures
                    Define the amount of time sensor monitors a specific 
                        frequency
                        channel
                      
                    Define authorized and unauthorized TCP/IP and UDP traffic

                  .
              
            
             
              
              Define authorized WLAN authentication and encryption schemes
              does not enforce, but rather establishes a baseline to determine if an unauthorized
              scheme is used. 
              If FAU_ANO_EXT.1 is included in the ST, "Specification
              of periods of network activity that constitute baseline of expected behavior" must be
              selected. If FAU_ANO_EXT.1 is included in the ST and "manual configuration by
              administrators" is selected in FAU_ANO_EXT.1, then "Definition of anomaly activity"
              must be selected. 
              If "can be configured to prevent transmission of
              data" is selected in FAU_WID_EXT.2 then "Enable/Disable transmission of data by
              wireless sensor" must be selected. 
              It is expected that an Authorized
              Administrator will be responsible for configuring the AP to operate on a specific
              frequency pursuant to the 802.11 standard. The TSF will have the ability to adjust
              the amount of time it passively monitors and captures WLAN traffic on a given
              frequency and channel.

                      Deploy an allowlisted AP and connect it to the protected wired
                        infrastructure via wire.
                      Confirm that the TSF can observe and capture traffic and events
                        generated by the AP.
                      Verify that the TSF can be configured to capture traffic on a specific
                        channel for specific interval of time, and assign a specified frequency and

                manual configuration by administrators
                automated configuration
              . 
             The "baseline" and "anomaly" can be something manually
              defined/configured by a TOE administrator (or importing definitions), or something
              that the TOE is able to automatically define/create by inspecting network traffic over
              a period of time (a.k.a. "profiling"). 
            
               The evaluator shall verify that the TSS describes the composition and
                construction of baselines or anomaly-based attributes specified in the SFR. The
                evaluator shall verify that the TSS provides a description of how baselines are
                defined and implemented by the TSF, or a description of how anomaly-based rules are
                defined and configured by the administrator.  The evaluator shall
                verify that the TSS describes the available modes of configuration (manual or
                automatic) and how to configure or import the baseline.
              
               The evaluator shall verify that the operational guidance describes how to
                configure baseline and/or anomalous traffic patterns based on what is stated in the
                TSS. The evaluator shall verify that the operational guidance
                describes how to perform automatic and/or manual definition of anomaly activity
                based on what is selected in the ST.
              
               The evaluator shall use the instructions in the operational guidance to
                configure baselines or anomaly-based rules through automated and/or manual means
                based on what is selected in the ST. The evaluator shall send traffic that does not
                match the baseline or matches the anomaly-based rule and verify the TSF detects the
                anomalous behavior and generates an alert. 
            
          
        
        
          This family defines requirements for detection of malicious network activity based on traffic signatures.
        
        
          
          This SFR defines operations to be performed on collected WIDS data, which is collected using an external interface defined in this PP-Module that extends the logical scope of the TOE beyond what the Base-PP defines.
          requires the TSF to support the definition of traffic signatures that can be compared to observed network traffic for the purpose of identifying potential malicious activity.
          The following actions could be considered for the management functions in FMT:

             The TSF shall support user-defined and customizable attack signatures. 
            
               The evaluator shall verify that the TSS describes the user-defined and

               The evaluator shall verify that the operational guidance provides
                information on how to configure user-defined and customizable attack signatures,

                        signature.
                    
                  
                
              
            
          
        
 
        
          
          
          
          
          This SFR iterates the FAU_STG_EXT.1 SFR defined in the Base-PP for storage of audit data and applies it to storage of packet captures.
          
          
          
          
          
            The TSF shall be able to transmit the generated packet captures to an external IT
              entity hosting a protocol analyzer using a trusted channel according to FTP_ITC.1. 
             Per FAU_STG_EXT.1 in the Base-PP, the TOE must support
              transfer of the audit data to an external IT entity using a trusted channel per
              FTP_ITC.1. Note that this PP-Module modifies FTP_ITC.1 from the Base-PP. If "capture
              raw frame traffic that triggers the violation" is selected in FAU_ARP.1, then this SFR
              must be included in the ST, and this iteration is for the PCAPs generated as a
              selectable action completed upon detection of a potential security violation in
              FAU_ARP.1. 
          
          
            
            The TSF shall be able to store generated packet captures on the TOE itself. In addition  
              The TOE shall be a distributed TOE that stores packet capture data on the following TOE components: identification of TOE components 
              The TOE shall be a distributed TOE with storage of packet capture data provided externally for the following TOE components: 
                list of TOE components that do not store packet capture data locally and the other TOE components to which they transmit their generated packet capture data
            .
            
          
          
             The TSF shall 
              drop new packet capture data
              overwrite previous packet captures according to the following rule:

             when the local storage space for packet capture data is full. 
            
               The evaluator shall verify that the TSS includes the list of trusted channels
                (as specified in FTP_ITC.1) available in the TSF to transmit packet captures to an
                external entity. The evaluator shall verify that the TSS describes the ability of
                the TOE to store packet capture data within itself, how much storage space is
                available for packet capture data and where that data is stored. The evaluator shall
                verify that the TSS describes the behavior of the TOE when local storage space for
                packet capture data is exhausted and whether this behavior is
                configurable.
              
               The evaluator shall verify that the operational guidance provides
                instructions on how to configure the trusted channel. If the behavior of the TOE
                when local storage space for packet capture data is exhausted is configurable, the
                evaluator shall verify that the operational guidance provides information on what
                the configurable behaviors are and how they can be set.
              
              
                
                  The evaluator shall configure packet captures according to the guidance
                    specified. The evaluator shall then trigger an event that starts a capture and
                    verify through the tests in FTP_ITC.1 that the captured traffic being sent to
                    the external device is being sent through a trusted channel.
                  The evaluator shall configure packet captures to be stored on the TSF
                    according to the guidance specified. The evaluator shall then trigger an event
                    that starts a capture and verify that the packet capture was stored on the
                    TSF.
                  The evaluator shall define packet data retention and deletion rules on the
                    TSF according to the guidance specified and test the functionality of the
                    specified rules.

                two sensors in non-overlapping locations receive traffic from the same MAC address
                simultaneously.
              
               The evaluator shall verify that the operational guidance provides
                instructions on how to deploy the TOE in a manner that allows the TSF to detect when
                two sensors in non-overlapping locations receive traffic from the same MAC address
                simultaneously (i.e. information about the range and placement of sensors to ensure
                non-overlapping coverage). The evaluator shall verify that the
                operational guidance provides instructions on how to configure the timeframe that
                should be allowed between two subsequent attempts for an EUD to connect from two
                separate locations.
              
              
                
                  
                    
                      Setup an allowlisted AP (Location 1).
                      Connect an allowlisted EUD to AP.
                      Setup a second allowlisted AP and a non-allowlisted EUD in a separate
                        non-overlapping location where the WIDS also has sensors. Or simulate the
                        distant non-verlapping locations by deploying the second AP in a shielded
                        environment connected to the valid network (Location 2).
                      Spoof the MAC address of the EUD in location 1 with the EUD in location
                        2 and connect it to the allowlisted AP in location 2. Make sure both EUDs
                        are connected at the same time.
                      Verify that the TSF detected and generated an alert.

          This family defines requirements for wireless intrusion prevention.
        
        
          This SFR defines WIPS behavior in response to detection of potential malicious activity in the TOE’s operational environment. This extends the logical scope of the TOE beyond what the Base-PP defines.
          requires the TSF to support reactive behavior if potential malicious traffic is observed to be originating from or targeted to a particular network asset.
          The following actions could be considered for the management functions in FMT: 
            Enabling or disabling transmission of data by wireless sensor
          
          
          
            The following actions should be auditable if FAU_GEN Security Audit Data Generation is included in the PP/ST: 
              Isolation of AP or EUD
            
          
          FAU_WID_EXT.1 Wireless Intrusion Detection - Malicious Environmental Objects
          
             The TSF shall allow an Authorized Administrator to isolate a wireless AP or EUD
              from the network monitored by the TSF using the following methods: 
                wireless containment
                wire-side containment of an unauthorized AP connected to the internal
                  corporate wired network
              .
            
            It is expected that an Authorized Administrator will be
              responsible for confirming the AP or EUD as a rogue AP or EUD to initiate wireless
              containment.  In this SFR the containment of an an unauthorized AP
              connected to the internal corporate wired network refers to an unauthorized AP that is
              physically connected (via wire) to the protected internal wired infrastructure. 
            
               The evaluator shall verify that the TSS includes a list of available containment
                methods on the TSF and how to configure them.
              
               There are no operational guidance activities for this SFR.
              
               Configure the containment methods available on the TSF and perform the
                following test for each method. 
                  
                    
                      Deploy a non-allowlisted AP and connect to the protected wired
                        infrastructure via wire (make sure it gets classified as rogue, or manually
                        classify as such).
                      Connect an allowlisted EUD to the AP.
                      Verify that TSF generates an alert, breaks the connection of the
                        allowlisted EUD from the rogue AP, and contains the rogue AP.

          This SFR defines preservation of a secure state in the event that a failure condition is detected. 
            The Base-PP does not define an SFR for this behavior but this SFR mitigates the T.SECURITY_FUNCTIONALITY_FAILURE threat defined in the Base-PP, 
            so it is clear that this behavior is consistent with the security expectations of the Base-PP.
          
             The TSF shall preserve a secure state when the following types of failures
              occur: [sensor functionality failure, potential compromise of the TSF]. 
             At minimum, the preservation of a secure state requires the
              generation of audit records when the defined failure conditions occur. 
            
               The evaluator shall review the TSS section to determine that the TOE’s
                implementation of the fail secure functionality is documented. The evaluator shall
                examine the TSS section to ensure that all failure modes specified in the ST are
                described.
              
               The evaluator shall review the operational guidance to verify that it
                identifies the potential TOE failures, how the TSF preserves a secure state
                following these failures, and any actions that are required to restore the TOE to
                normal operation following the transition to a failure state. 
              
              
                
                  For each failure mode specified in the ST, the evaluator shall ensure that
                    the TOE attains a secure state after initiating each failure mode type.
