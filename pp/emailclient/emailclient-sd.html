    to describe the security functionality of 
     products in terms of 
    [CC] and to define functional and assurance requirements for them.
    This PP-Module is intended for use with the
    <a href='https://www.niap-ccevs.org/Profile/Info.cfm?PPID=394&amp;id=394'></a>.</p><p>This SD is mandatory for evaluations of TOEs that claim conformance to the PP-Module for , version .
    Although Evaluation Activities are defined mainly for the evaluators to follow, in general they also help Developers to prepare for evaluation by identifying specific requirements for their TOE.
    The specific requirements in Evaluation Activities may in some cases clarify the meaning of Security
    Functional Requirements (SFR), and may identify particular requirements for the content of Security
    Targets (ST) (especially the TOE Summary Specification), user guidance documentation, and possibly
    supplementary information (e.g. for entropy analysis or cryptographic key management architecture).</p><h2 id='structure' class='indexable' data-level='1'>1.2 Structure of the Document</h2><p>Evaluation Activities can be defined for both SFRs and Security Assurance Requirements (SAR),
    which are themselves defined in separate sections of the SD.</p><p>If any Evaluation Activity cannot be successfully completed in an evaluation then
    the overall verdict for the evaluation is a 'fail'.
    In rare cases there may be acceptable reasons why an Evaluation Activity
    may be modified or deemed not applicable for a particular TOE, 
    but this must be approved by the Certification Body for the evaluation.</p><p>In general, if all Evaluation Activities (for both SFRs and SARs) are successfully
    completed in an evaluation then it would be expected that the overall verdict for 
    the evaluation is a ‘pass’.
    To reach a ‘fail’ verdict when the Evaluation Activities have been successfully 
    completed would require a specific justification from the evaluator as to why the 
    Evaluation Activities were not sufficient for that TOE.
    </p><p>Similarly, at the more granular level of Assurance Components, if the Evaluation 
    Activities for an Assurance Component and all of its related SFR Evaluation 
    Activities are successfully completed in an evaluation then it would be expected 
    that the verdict for the Assurance Component is a ‘pass’.
    To reach a ‘fail’ verdict for the Assurance Component when these Evaluation 
    Activities have been successfully completed would require a specific justification 
    from the evaluator as to why the Evaluation Activities were not sufficient for that TOE.

    to address technology specific aspects covering specific SARs (e.g. ASE_TSS.1, 
    ADV_FSP.1, AGD_OPE.1, and ATE_IND.1) – this is in addition to the CEM work units 
    that are performed in <a href='#sar_aas' class='dynref'>6 Evaluation Activities for SARs</a>.</p><p>Regarding design descriptions (designated by the subsections labelled TSS, as 
    well as any required supplementary material that may be treated as proprietary), 
    the evaluator must ensure there is specific information that satisfies the EA. 
    For findings regarding the TSS section, the evaluator’s verdicts will be 
    associated with the CEM work unit ASE_TSS.1-1.
    Evaluator verdicts associated with the supplementary evidence will also be 
    associated with ASE_TSS.1-1, 
    since the requirement to provide such evidence is specified in ASE in the cPP.</p><p>For ensuring the guidance documentation provides sufficient information for 
    the administrators/users as it pertains to SFRs, the evaluator’s verdicts will 
    be associated with CEM work units ADV_FSP.1-7, AGD_OPE.1-4, and AGD_OPE.1-5.</p><p>Finally, the subsection labelled Tests is where the authors have determined 
    that testing of the product in the context of the associated SFR is necessary.
    While the evaluator is expected to develop tests, there may be instances where 
    it is more practical for the developer to construct tests, or where the 
    developer may have existing tests. 
    Therefore, it is acceptable for the evaluator to witness developer-generated 
    tests in lieu of executing the tests. 
    In this case, the evaluator must ensure the developer’s tests are executing both 
    in the manner declared by the developer and as mandated by the EA. 
    The CEM work units that are associated with the EAs specified in this section 
    are: ATE_IND.1-3, ATE_IND.1-4, ATE_IND.1-5, ATE_IND.1-6, and ATE_IND.1-7.</p><h2 class='indexable' data-level='1' id='aa-$ApSo'>2.1 Application Software Protection Profile

		<div class='eacategory'>TSS</div>
		The evaluator verifies that the version of S/MIME implemented by the email client is present in the TSS. The evaluator also verifies that the algorithms supported are specified, and that the algorithms specified are those listed for this component.
		<br/>The evaluator verifies that the TSS describes the ContentEncryptionAlgorithmIdentifier and whether the required behavior is performed by default or may be configured.
		<br/>The evaluator verifies that the TSS describes the digestAlgorithm and whether the required behavior is performed by default or may be configured.
		<br/>The evaluator verifies that the TSS describes the AlgorithmIdentifier and whether the required behavior is performed by default or may be configured.
		<br/>The evaluator verifies that the TSS describes the retrieval mechanisms for both certificates and certificate revocation as well as the frequency at which these mechanisms are implemented.

		<div class='eacategory'>Guidance</div>
		The evaluator also reviews the Operational Guidance to ensure that it contains instructions on configuring the email client such that it complies with the description in the TSS.
		<br/>If the TSS indicates that the algorithms in FCS_SMIME_EXT.1.2 must be configured to meet the requirement, the evaluator verifies that the AGD guidance includes the configuration of this ID.
		<br/>If the TSS indicates that the algorithms in FCS_SMIME_EXT.1.3 must be configured to meet the requirement, the evaluator verifies that the AGD guidance includes the configuration.
		<br/>If the TSS indicates that the algorithms in FCS_SMIME_EXT.1.4 must be configured to meet the requirement, the evaluator verifies that the AGD guidance includes the configuration of this ID.
		<br/>If the TSS indicates that the mechanisms in FCS_SMIME_EXT.1.7 are configurable, the evaluator verifies that the AGD guidance includes the configuration of these mechanisms.
		<div class='eacategory'>Tests</div>
		The evaluator performs the following tests:
		<br/>These tests can be performed in conjunction with the tests specified in FIA_X509_EXT.1 (defined in ) for certificate/certificate chain verification and FDP_NOT_EXT.1.
		<br/>Test 1: The evaluator both sends and receives a message with no protection (no signature or encryption) and verify that the message is transmitted properly and can be viewed at the receiving agent. This transmission can be performed as part of a number of mechanisms; it is sufficient to observe that the message arrives at the intended recipient with the same content as when sent.
		<br/>Test 2: The evaluator both sends and receives a signed message using each of the algorithms specified in the ST corresponding to the requirement and verify that the signature is valid for both received and sent messages. After verifying the signatures are valid, the evaluator sends a signed message using each of the algorithms specified in the ST and use a maninthemiddle tool to modify at least one byte of the message such that the signature is no longer valid. This can be done by modifying the content of the message over which the signature is calculated or by modifying the signature itself. The evaluator verifies that the received message fails the signature validation check.
		<br/>Test 3: The evaluator both sends and receives an encrypted message using each of the algorithms specified in the ST.
		The evaluator verifies that the contents are encrypted in transit and that the received message decrypts. 
		After verifying the message decrypts, the evaluator sends an encrypted message using each of the algorithms specified in the ST and use a maninthemiddle tool to modify at least one byte of the message such that the encryption is no longer valid. The evaluator verifies that the received message fails to decrypt.
		<br/>Test 4: The evaluator both sends and receives a message that is both signed and encrypted. In addition, the evaluator uses a man-in-the-middle tool to modify at least one byte of the message such that the encryption and signature are no longer valid. The evaluator verifies that the received message fails to decrypt, fails the signature validation check, and/or both.
		<br/>Test 5: The evaluator sends a signed message to the email client using a signature algorithm not supported according to the digestAlgorithm ID (e.g., SHA1). The evaluator verifies that the email client provides a notification that the contents cannot be verified because the signature algorithm is not supported.
		<br/>Test 6: The evaluator sends an encrypted message to the email client using an encryption algorithm not supported according to the AlgorithmIdentifier field. The evaluator verifies that the email client does not display/decrypt the contents of the message.
		<br/>Test 7: The evaluator sends the email client a message signed by a certificate without the digitalSignature bit set. The evaluator verifies that the email client notifies the user that the signature is invalid.
		<br/>Test 8: The evaluator sends the email client a message signed by a certificate without the Email Protection purpose in the extendedKeyUsage. The evaluator verifies that the email client notifies the user that the signature is invalid.
		<br/>Test 9: The evaluator verifies that the email client uses OCSP or downloads the CRL at the assigned frequency.
	      </div><div class='comp' id='FCS_CKM_EXT.3'><h4>FCS_CKM_EXT.3 Protection of Key and Key Material</h4>
		<div class='eacategory'>TSS</div>
		The evaluator verifies the TSS for a high level description of method used to protect keys stored in nonvolatile memory.
		<br/>The evaluator verifies the TSS to ensure it describes the storage location of all keys and the protection of all keys stored in nonvolatile memory. The description of the key chain shall be reviewed to ensure FCS_COP_EXT.2 is followed for the storage of wrapped or encrypted keys in nonvolatile memory and plaintext keys in nonvolatile memory meet one of the criteria for storage.
	      </div><div class='comp' id='FCS_CKM_EXT.4'><h4>FCS_CKM_EXT.4 Cryptographic Key Destruction</h4>
		<div class='eacategory'>TSS</div>
		If the platform provides the key destruction, then the evaluator examines the TSS to verify that it describes how the key destruction functionality is invoked.
		<br/>If the application invokes key destruction, the evaluator checks to ensure the TSS describes each of the secret keys (keys used for symmetric encryption and/or data authentication), private keys, and CSPs used to generate key; when they are zeroized (for example, immediately after use, on system shutdown, etc.); and the type of zeroization procedure that is performed (overwrite with zeros, overwrite three times with random pattern, etc.). If different types of memory are used to store the materials to be protected, the evaluator checks to ensure that the TSS describes the zeroization procedure in terms of the memory in which the data are stored (for example, "secret keys stored on a drive are zeroized by overwriting once with zeros, while secret keys stored on the internal hard drive are zeroized by overwriting three times with a random pattern that is changed before each write").
		<div class='eacategory'>Tests</div>
		The following test is only for key destruction provided by the email client:
		<br/>Test 1: For each type of authorization service, encryption mode and encryption operation, a known authorization factor, and chain of keys must be provided to the evaluator with an associated ciphertext data set (e.g. if a passphrase is used to create a intermediate key, then the ciphertext containing the encrypted key as well as the intermediate key itself must be provided to the evaluator.) The evaluator will use the email client in conjunction with a debugging or forensics utility to attempt to authorize themselves, resulting in the generation of a key or decryption of a key. The evaluator will ascertain from the TSS what the vendor defines as "no longer needed" and execute the sequence of actions via the email client to invoke this state. At this point, the evaluator should take a dump of volatile memory and search the retrieved dump for the provided authorization credentials or keys (e.g. if the password was "PaSSw0rd", perform a string search of the forensics dump for "PaSSw0rd"). The evaluator must document each command, program or action taken during this process, and must confirm that no plaintext keying material resides in volatile memory. The evaluator must perform this test three times to ensure repeatability. If during the course of this testing the evaluator finds that keying material remains in volatile memory, they should be able to identify the cause (i.e. execution of the grep command for "PaSSw0rd" caused a false positive) and document the reason for failure to comply with this requirement.
