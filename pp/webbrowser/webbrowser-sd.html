    PP-Module for Web Browsers is
    to describe the security functionality of 
      Web Browsers products in terms of 
    [CC] and to define functional and assurance requirements for them.

    
    The PP-Module is intended for use with the following Base-PP:
        <ul><li><a href="">
    Protection Profile for Application Software, Version </a></li></ul><br/>
    This SD is mandatory for evaluations of TOEs that claim conformance to a PP-Configuration that includes the PP-Module for :
    <ul><li>Web Browsers, Version 1.0</li></ul>
    As such it defines Evaluation Activities for the functionality described in the PP-Module as well as any impacts to the Evaluation Activites to the Base-PP(s) it modifies.
    </p><p> 
Although Evaluation Activities are defined mainly for the evaluators to follow, in general they also help developers to prepare for evaluation by identifying specific requirements for their TOE.
    The specific requirements in Evaluation Activities may in some cases clarify the meaning of Security
    Functional Requirements (SFR), and may identify particular requirements for the content of Security
    Targets (ST) (especially the TOE Summary Specification), user guidance documentation, and possibly
    supplementary information (e.g. for entropy analysis or cryptographic key management architecture).</p><h2 id="structure" class="indexable" data-level="1">1.2 Structure of the Document</h2><p>Evaluation Activities can be defined for both SFRs and Security Assurance Requirements (SAR),
    which are themselves defined in separate sections of the SD.</p><p>If any Evaluation Activity cannot be successfully completed in an evaluation, then
    the overall verdict for the evaluation is a 'fail'.
    In rare cases there may be acceptable reasons why an Evaluation Activity
    may be modified or deemed not applicable for a particular TOE, 
    but this must be approved by the Certification Body for the evaluation.</p><p>In general, if all Evaluation Activities (for both SFRs and SARs) are successfully
    completed in an evaluation then it would be expected that the overall verdict for 
    the evaluation is a ‘pass’.
    To reach a ‘fail’ verdict when the Evaluation Activities have been successfully 
    completed would require a specific justification from the evaluator as to why the 
    Evaluation Activities were not sufficient for that TOE.
    </p><p>Similarly, at the more granular level of assurance components, if the Evaluation 
    Activities for an assurance component and all of its related SFR Evaluation 
    Activities are successfully completed in an evaluation then it would be expected 
    that the verdict for the assurance component is a ‘pass’.
    To reach a ‘fail’ verdict for the assurance component when these Evaluation 
    Activities have been successfully completed would require a specific justification 
    from the evaluator as to why the Evaluation Activities were not sufficient for that TOE.

    to address technology specific aspects covering specific SARs (e.g. ASE_TSS.1, 
    ADV_FSP.1, AGD_OPE.1, and ATE_IND.1) – this is in addition to the CEM work units 
    that are performed in Section <a href="#sar_aas" class="dynref"> 3 Evaluation Activities for SARs</a>.</p><p>Regarding design descriptions (designated by the subsections labelled TSS, as 
    well as any required supplementary material that may be treated as proprietary), 
    the evaluator must ensure there is specific information that satisfies the EA. 
    For findings regarding the TSS section, the evaluator’s verdicts will be 
    associated with the CEM work unit ASE_TSS.1-1.
    Evaluator verdicts associated with the supplementary evidence will also be 
    associated with ASE_TSS.1-1, 
    since the requirement to provide such evidence is specified in ASE in the PP.</p><p>For ensuring the guidance documentation provides sufficient information for 
    the administrators/users as it pertains to SFRs, the evaluator’s verdicts will 
    be associated with CEM work units ADV_FSP.1-7, AGD_OPE.1-4, and AGD_OPE.1-5.</p><p>Finally, the subsection labelled Tests is where the authors have determined 
    that testing of the product in the context of the associated SFR is necessary.
    While the evaluator is expected to develop tests, there may be instances where 
    it is more practical for the developer to construct tests, or where the 
    developer may have existing tests. 
    Therefore, it is acceptable for the evaluator to witness developer-generated 
    tests in lieu of executing the tests. 
    In this case, the evaluator must ensure the developer’s tests are executing both 
    in the manner declared by the developer and as mandated by the EA.

                                            operational guidance. The evaluator shall initiate a
                                            connection with a known good website while sniffing the
                                            network traffic using a network protocol analyzer. The
                                            evaluator shall inspect the captured network traffic and
                                            shall verify that the browser initiates a connection to the
                                            configured URL reputation service(s).</li>

                                            operational guidance. The evaluator shall initiate a
                                            connection with a known malicious website that is identified
                                            by one or more of the URL reputation services while sniffing
                                            the network traffic using a network protocol analyzer. The
                                            evaluator shall verify that a warning appears alerting that
                                            the website is known to be malicious and the browser is not
                                            allowed to connect. The evaluator shall inspect the captured
                                            network traffic and shall verify that the browser initiates
                                            a connection to the configured URL reputation service(s) and
                                            retrieved an updated list of malicious URLs with the tested

    Application Software PP base to which it must claim conformance.
	It is important to note that a TOE that is evaluated against the PP-Module is
	inherently evaluated against this Base-PP as well. 
	The Application Software PP 
        includes a number of Evaluation Activities associated with both SFRs and SARs.
	Additionally, the PP-Module includes a number of SFR-based Evaluation Activities 
	that similarly refine the SARs of the Base-PPs.
	The evaluation laboratory will evaluate the TOE against the Base-PP
      
    and supplement that evaluation with the necessary SFRs that are taken from the PP-Module.
