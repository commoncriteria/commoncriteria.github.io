    <h2 id='ppoverview' class='indexable' data-level='2'>1.1 Overview</h2> 
	 The scope of the File Encryption Enterprise Management <a class='abbr' href='#abbr_PP-Module'><abbr title='Protection Profile Module'>PP-Module</abbr></a> is to describe the security functionality of a file encryption 
	    enterprise management product in terms of [<a class='abbr' href='#abbr_CC'><abbr title='Common Criteria'>CC</abbr></a>] and to define functional and assurance requirements for such products. 
      This <a class='abbr' href='#abbr_PP-Module'><abbr title='Protection Profile Module'>PP-Module</abbr></a> is intended for use with the following Base-PP<br/><br/> 
      <ul>
        <li>Application Software Protection Profile, Version 1.3</li>
      </ul>
      <br/> This Base-PP is valid because a file encryption enterprise management product is
      a 3rd party application.    
	    
    
    The use case for a product conforming to the FE module is to protect data at rest on a device
    that is lost or stolen while powered off without any prior access by an adversary. The use case
    where an adversary obtains a device that is in a powered state and is able to make modifications
    to the environment or the TOE itself (e.g., evil maid attacks) is not addressed by that module. The module
	    does contain protections to mitigate the potential for attack with a powered on device, but they are not sufficient 
	    to protect data from a skilled adversary with physical access.<br/><br/>
      
      While that use case is still true for the Enterprise Management PP-Module, this PP-module also
      expands the use case to include protecting the communications between the Enterprise
      Management Server and the client device through the use of a trusted channel. It also expands
      the use case to include the optional abilities of the EM to interact with clients (with proper
      authorization), to direct it to perform sanitation of keys and material on the device, 
      to manage and store parts of the key chain required for decryption on the client, or to issue a
      recovery credential to reset the authentication factor if it has been lost.<br/><br/>
      
      The TOE and Its Supporting Environment:<br/>
      
      The environment in which the EM functions is expected to exist is on a back end server, not
      on the endpoint system. It is expected to have secure access to a management system
      (e.g. Active Directory) and access to a means of storing key material when not in use.
      The EM shall not have the ability to access the secured stored key material without verification
      of access authority by the LDAP.<br/><br/>
      The Operating System environment may make a full range of services available to the
      Enterprise Management PP-Module, including hardware drivers, cryptographic libraries, and
      perhaps other services external to the TOE.
      The EM TOE may include or leverage features and functions within the operational
      environment.

          The application, which consists of the software provided by its vendor,
          is installed onto the platform(s) it operates on.  It executes on the platform, which
          may be an operating system, hardware environment, 
          a software based execution environment, 
          or some combination of these. Those platforms may themselves run within other
          environments, such as virtual machines or operating systems, that completely abstract away the underlying hardware
          from the application. The TOE is not accountable for security functionality that is implemented by 
          platform layers that are abstracted away.
          Some evaluation activities are specific to the particular platform
          on which the application runs, in order to provide precision and
          repeatability. The only platforms currently recognized by <a href='#bibAppPP'>[AppPP]</a> and this module are those specified in SFR Evaluation Activities.
          To test on a platform for which there are no EAs, a Vendor should contact NIAP with recommended EAs.
          NIAP will determine if the proposed platform is appropriate for the PP and accept, reject,
          or develop EAs as necessary in coordination with the technical community.
        </p><p>	
          The TOE includes 
          any software in the application installation package, even those pieces that may 
          extend or modify the functionality of the underlying platform, such as kernel drivers.

            or any other values that contribute to the creation of keys or authorization factors could allow an unauthorized user to defeat
            the encryption. This PP-Module considers possession of key material of equal importance to the data itself. Threat agents may

      <h2 id='assumptions' class='indexable' data-level='2'>3.2 Assumptions</h2>
These assumptions are made on the Operational Environment in order to be able to ensure that the
security functionality specified in the PP-Module can be provided by the TOE. If the TOE is placed in an

            <b>Key Material Server:</b>
            The keying material that threat agents may attempt to compromise are generated by the TOE as specified by FCS_CKM.1(2). 
            One or more submasks may be utilized on the endpoint to protect the FEK or a KEK, part of the keychain to protect that
            is stored on the server for additional authorization or recovery. The server key chain can be maintained by several methods,
            including: <br/><br/>
            
            <li>Key establishment [FCS_CKM.2]</li>
            <li>Key derivation [FCS_KDF_EXT.1]</li>
            <li>Key wrapping [FCS_COP.1(5)]</li>
            <li>Key combining [FCS_SMC_EXT.1]</li>
            <li>Key encryption [FCS_COP.1(7)]</li>
            <li>Key Transport [FCS_COP.1(6)]</li>
            
            Key chains may be maintained using asymmetric [FCS_CKM_EXT.1] and/or symmetric [FCS_CKM.1(2)]. <br/><br/>
            
            These requirements ensure keys are properly generated and protected. If selected, FMT_MOF.1 ensures that
            only administrators can select the encryption algorithms and key sizes. Only administrators can perform management

            functions on the Enterprise Management Server as defined in FMT_SMF.1. <br/><br/>

            FCS_KYC_EXT.1 extends the requirements of File Encryption PP-Module key chaining to key chains generated or maintained by the Server. <br/><br/>
            
            FPT_ITT.1 ensures that keys and key material transported between the EM and the endpoint are protected. <br/><br/>
            
            FPT_KYP_EXT.1 ensures unwrapped key material is not stored in non-volatile memory minimizing the exposure of plaintext keys and key material.<br/><br/>
            
            FTP_DIT_EXT.1 specifies the protocols used to ensure that key material is not exposed through the communication channel between an Enterprise Server and the endpoint. The requirements for establishing keys are validated by FCS_CKM.2 which relies on the SFRs or package claims selected in FTP_DIT_EXT.1
            to implement secure communications.
		   
            The various iterations of FCS_COP.1 as well as FCS_RBG_EXT.1 all validate that the cryptography used to initiate and protect
            the communication channel protocols between the Enterprise Server and the endpoint, if remote management is supported by the TSF. If implemented
            on the server, FCS_CKM_EXT.4 ensures proper destruction of keys and key material on the server when no longer needed.<br/><br/>
            
            In order to ensure that a key is only released to the appropriate endpoint, FCS_KYP_EXT.3 ensures that there is attribution of the endpoint
            or encrypted file(s) and a key. The optional Server requirement FCS_CKM.2 ensures that if a key is communicated between the server and the
            endpoint, keys distributed by the server are given to the correct endpoint for the purpose of delivering a key.<br/><br/>
            
            To ensure the key chain is started properly, FIA_AUT_EXT.1 defines proper authentication and conditioning.

            <b>Secure Channel:</b> FPT_ITT.1 ensures protection of intra TOE communication and FTP_DIT_EXT.1 covers all transmitted sensitive data. If server side key generation is implemented, 
            FCS_CKM.1(1) ensures sufficiently strong keys correctly generated on the server to meet the requirements of FTP_TRP.1. 
            Products implementing cryptographic communication protocols between the server and managed endpoints must meet the requirements 
            for the specific protocols as defined in any of {FCS_HTTPS_EXT.1, PP-Module for VPN Client, FCS_SSHC_EXT.1, 
		  FCS_SSHS_EXT.1, FCS_TLSC_EXT.1, FCS_TLSS_EXT.1}<br/><br/>
		  
            
            
            If the EM Server generates signatures to request or verify certificates, FCS_COP.1(1) ensures correct cryptographic
            operation in signature generation process. <br/><br/>
          
          The TOE is not required to support remote administration. If it does, FTP_TRP.1 addresses the threat of disclosure of keys, key material, or recovery material transferred between
          the endpoint or a remote administrator and the Management Server when transmitted over untrusted communication channels
          by requiring use of IPsec, SSH, TLS, and/or TLS/HTTPS protocols when such data passes through those channels.<br/><br/>
            
            FTP_DIT_EXT.1, which is modified from its definition in the Base-PP to mandate the use of at least one trusted communications protocol, specifies the
            protocols used to ensure that data in transit over this channel is secured.<br/><br/>
            
            FIA_X509_EXT.1, FIA_X509_EXT.2, and FIA_X509_EXT.3 ensure

            If the TSF generates password authorization factors, the requirements of FCS_PCC_EXT.1 and FCS_CKM_EXT.6 ensure that the password data is not subjected
            to unauthorized disclosure or brute force attack.

              The interface referenced in the requirement could take different forms, the most likely 
              of which is an application programming interface to an OS kernel. There may be various levels of abstraction visible. 
              For instance, in a given implementation that overwrites a key stored in non-volatile memory, the application may have 
              access to the file system details and may be able to logically address specific memory locations. In another 
              implementation that instructs the underlying platform to destroy the representation of a key stored in non-volatile 
              memory, the application may simply have a handle to a resource and can only ask the platform to delete the resource, 
              as may be the case with a platforms secure key store. The latter implementation should only be used for the most 
              restricted access. The level of detail to which the TOE has access will be reflected in the TSS section of the ST. 
              Several selections allow assignment of a 'value that does not contain any CSP'. This means that the TOE uses some 
              other specified data not drawn from a source that may contain key material or reveal information about key material, 
              and not being any of the particular values listed as other selection options. The point of the phrase 'does not contain 
              any CSP' is to ensure that the overwritten data is carefully selected, and not taken from a general 'pool' that might 
              contain current or residual data that itself requires confidentiality protection.<br/><br/>
              
              For the selection "destruction of all KEKs protecting target key, where 
              none of the KEKs protecting the target key are derived", a key can be considered destroyed by destroying the key that 
              protects the key. If a key is wrapped or encrypted it is not necessary to "overwrite" that key, overwriting the key 
              that is used to wrap or encrypt the key used to encrypt/decrypt data, using the appropriate method for the memory 
              type involved, will suffice. For example, if a product uses a Key Encryption Key (KEK) to encrypt a File Encryption 
              Key (FEK), destroying the KEK using one of the methods in FCS_CKM_EXT.4 is sufficient, since the FEK would no longer 
              be usable (of course, presumes the FEK is still encrypted and the KEK cannot be recovered or re-derived). </span></div>

              Keys, including intermediate keys and key material that are no longer
              needed are destroyed by using an approved method, FCS_CKM_EXT.4.1. Examples of keys are
              intermediate keys, submasks. There may be instances where keys or key material
              that are contained in persistent storage are no longer needed and require destruction. 
              Base on their implementation, vendors will explain when certain keys are no longer needed. There
              are multiple situations in which key material is no longer necessary, for example, a wrapped
              key may need to be destroyed when a password is changed. However, there are instances
              when keys are allowed to remain in memory, for example, a device identification key. If a
              PIN was used for a smart card and managed by the TOE, ensuring that the PIN was properly destroyed must be addressed.

                <h4>KMD</h4>   
                The evaluator examines the KMD to ensure it describes how the keys are managed in volatile memory. 
                This description includes details of how each identified key is introduced into volatile memory (e.g. by derivation 
                from user input, or by unwrapping a wrapped key stored in non-volatile memory) and how they are overwritten.<br/><br/>
                
                The evaluator shall check to ensure the KMD lists each type of key that is stored in in non-volatile memory, and 
                identifies how the TOE interacts with the underlying platform to manage keys (e.g., store, retrieve, destroy). 
                The description includes details on the method of how the TOE interacts with the platform, including an identification 
                and description of the interfaces it uses to manage keys (e.g., file system APIs, platform key store APIs).<br/><br/>
                
                The evaluator examines the interface description for each different media type to ensure that the 
                interface supports the selection(s) and description in the KMD.<br/><br/>
                
                If the ST makes use of the open assignment and fills in the type of pattern that is used, the evaluator 
                examines the KMD to ensure it describes how that pattern is obtained and used. The evaluator shall

                keychain in the KMD and identify each instance when a key is destroyed by this method. In each instance the evaluator 
                shall verify all keys capable of decrypting the target key are destroyed in accordance with a specified key destruction 
                method in FCS_CKM_EXT.4.1. The evaluator shall verify that all of the keys capable of decrypting the target key are not

                and key material are no longer needed, and how the material is destroyed once it is not
                needed and that the documentation in the KMD follows FCS_CKM_EXT.4.1 for the

              <div class='eacategory'>Guidance</div>There are a variety of concerns that may prevent or delay key destruction in some cases.<br/><br/>
                
                The evaluator shall check that the guidance documentation identifies configurations or circumstances that may 
                not strictly conform to the key destruction requirement, and that this description is consistent with the 
                relevant parts of the TSS and any other relevant Required Supplementary Information.<br/><br/>
                
                The evaluator shall check that the guidance documentation provides guidance on situations where key 
                destruction may be delayed at the physical layer and how such situations can be avoided or mitigated if possible.<br/><br/>
                
                Some examples of what is expected to be in the documentation are provided here. <br/><br/>
                
                When the TOE does not have full access to the physical memory, it is possible that the storage may be implementing 
                wear-leveling and garbage collection. This may create additional copies of the key that are logically inaccessible 
                but persist physically. In this case, to mitigate this the drive should support the TRIM command and implements 
                garbage collection to destroy these persistent copies when not actively engaged in other tasks.<br/><br/>
                
                Drive vendors implement garbage collection in a variety of different ways, as such there is a variable amount of time 
                until data is truly removed from these solutions. There is a risk that data may persist for a longer amount of time 
                if it is contained in a block with other data not ready for erasure. To reduce this risk, the operating system and 
                file system of the OE should support TRIM, instructing the non-volatile memory to erase copies via garbage collection 
                upon their deletion. If a RAID array is being used, only set-ups that support TRIM are utilized. If the drive is 
                connected via PCI-Express, the operating system supports TRIM over that channel.<br/><br/>
                
                The drive should be healthy and contains minimal corrupted data and should be end of lifed before a significant 
                amount of damage to drive health occurs, this minimizes the risk that small amounts of 
                potentially recoverable data may remain in damaged areas of the drive.<br/><br/>

		The evaluator will test the authenticated encryption functionality of AES-KW for EACH
		combination of the following input parameter lengths:
              <ul>
                <li>128 and 256 bit key encryption keys (KEKs)</li>
                <li>Three plaintext lengths. One of the plaintext lengths shall be two semi-blocks (128
                  bits). One of the plaintext lengths shall be three semi-blocks (192 bits). The third data
                  unit length shall be the longest supported plaintext length less than or equal to 64

              using a set of 100 key and plaintext pairs and obtain the ciphertext that results from AES-KW
              authenticated encryption. To determine correctness, the evaluator will use the AES-KW
              authenticated-encryption function of a known good implementation.

              The testing for CCM consists of five tests. To determine correctness in each of the below tests,

              Variable Payload Test<br/>
              For each supported key size and payload length, and any supported associated data length, nonce length, and tag length, 
		    the evaluator shall supply one key value, one nonce value, and 10 pairs of associated data and payload values, and

		    obtain the resulting ciphertext.<br/><br/>
              
              Decryption-Verification Process Test<br/>
              To test the decryption-verification functionality of AES-CCM, for each combination of supported associated data length, 
		    payload length, nonce length, and tag length, the evaluator shall supply a key value and 15 sets of input plus 
		    ciphertext, and obtain the decrypted payload. Ten of the 15 input sets supplied should fail verification and five 
		    should pass.<br/>

                If the KTS-OAEP scheme was selected, the evaluator shall perform the following
                tests:
                <ul>

                    256 or 384 bytes depending on RSA key size. The evaluator shall also feed into

                    decryption primitive to compute em = RSADP((n,d),c) and convert em to the
                    encoded message EM. The evaluator shall then check that the first byte of EM
                    is 0x00. The evaluator shall also feed into the TOE's RSA-OEAP decryption

                    more consecutive 0x00 bytes and K is the transported keying material. The

              specifically assigned an unprivileged role by the TSF or it may be characterized by an individual that lacks an administrator account on the TOE<br/><br/>
              
              The TSF may optionally provide the ability to rely on an external authentication mechanism to identify users in the case of a user requesting distribution
              of a recovery credential. In this situation, the TOE’s reliance on the Operational Environment is functionally equivalent to the TSF
              maintaining the user role as defined by FMT_SMR.2.1.<br/>

                  sends the result to the user's client. The user's client shall perform the actions necessary to accept the updated configuration (e.g. encrypt the data
                  with the new key, update the encryption algorithm key size or mode and re-encrypt).</li>

                  factor(s) for each administrator. The evaluator shall verify that both administrators can log into the Enterprise Server using the provided authorization factors.
                  The evaluator shall then exercise the management functions to change the authorization factor values for the first administrator to a new one on the Enterprise Server.
                  Then he or she will verify that the Enterprise Server denies the first administrator access to the Management Console when the first administrator logs in with the old
                  or original authorization factor to gain access. The evaluator shall also verify that the second administrator is still able to log in to the Enterprise Server with

			and shall verify that the user is denied access after surpassing that limit. </li>
                
                <li><b>Test 8: </b>If the TOE provides the capability to disable management of any capability allowed in the EM PP-Module, the evaluator shall devise a test that
                  ensures that each capability which can be disabled has been or can be disabled following guidance provided by the vendor. </li>
                
                <li><b>Test 9: </b>If the TOE provides the capability to manage capabilities in place of the File Encryption Clients, where those administrative capabilities are then disabled in the File Encryption Clients,
                  the evaluator shall devise a test that ensures that each capability which can be disabled in the File Encryption Clients and can be subsequently managed by the EM is tested as follows:
                  
                  Disable the administrative capability in a File Encryption Client and enable it in the EM.

        Specifically, this PP-Module defines a method of maliciously gaining access to sensitive data at rest that is particular to the technology type of this PP-Module.</td></tr><tr><td>T.MAN_IN_THE_MIDDLE</td><td>This threat is a specific example of T.NETWORK_EAVESDROP defined in the Base-PP.

	  The objectives for the TOEs are consistent with the App PP based on the following rationale:
      <table><tr><th>PP-Module TOE Objective</th><th>Consistency Rationale</th></tr><tr><td>O.ENTERPRISE_KEY_PROTECTION</td><td>
            This objective is consistent with the Base-PP because the Base-PP includes the O.PROTECTED_STORAGE objective. 
            The protection and timely destruction of key materials is consistent with the intent of that objective.
          </td></tr><tr><td>O.KEY_MATERIAL_SERVER</td><td>
            This objective is consistent with the Base-PP because the Base-PP includes the O.PROTECTED_STORAGE and O.PROTECTED_COMMS objectives.
            This objective defines behavior for the secure storage and transmission of decryption and recovery key data, consistent with the relevant objectives in the Base-PP.            
          </td></tr><tr><td>O.RECOVERY_PROTECTION</td><td>
            This objective defines usage restrictions and supported behavior for the TOE's management interface. This is consistent with the O.MANAGE objective in the Base-PP for
            functionality that is specific to this PP-Module.
          </td></tr><tr><td>O.SECURE_CHANNEL</td><td>
            This objective is consistent with the Base-PP because the Base-PP defines the O.PROTECTED_COMMS objective for security of data in transit. Specifically, this objective
            expects the communications between distributed TOE components to be protected in a similar manner to the corresponding Base-PP objective.
          </td></tr><tr><td>O.VERIFIED_ADMIN</td><td>
            This objective is consistent with the O.MANAGE objective in the Base-PP and further restricts it by limiting security-relevant management interfaces to authenticated administrators.
            It also supports the enforcement of the OE.PROPER_ADMIN environmental objective by reducing the likelihood that administrative actions are performed unintentionally.
          </td></tr></table></p><p>
	  The objectives for the TOE's Operational Environment are consistent with the App PP based on the following rationale:
      <table><tr><th>PP-Module Operational Environment Objective</th><th>Consistency Rationale</th></tr><tr><td>OE.ENVIRONMENTAL_STORAGE</td><td>
            This objective is consistent with the Base-PP because the Base-PP allows for the TOE to use platform-provided key storage.
          </td></tr><tr><td>OE.PHYSICAL_SERVER</td><td>
           This objective is consistent with the Base-PP because it is an extension of the Base-PP's OE.PLATFORM objective that is specific to this technology type.

         </td></tr><tr><td>OE.SECURED_CONFIGURATION</td><td>
            This objective is consistent with the Base-PP because it expects the TOE's operational guidance to be responsibly followed in the same manner as OE.PROPER_ADMIN in the

      This PP-Module identifies several SFRs from the 
      App PP that are needed to support 
      File Encryption Enterprise Management functionality.
      This is considered to be consistent because the functionality provided by the

      The PP-Module also identifies a number of modified SFRs from the 
      App PP
      as well as new SFRs that are used entirely to provide functionality for 
      File Encryption Enterprise Management.
      The rationale for why this does not conflict with the claims

            This applies to passwords on the enterprise server.<br/>
            
            The password/passphrase is represented on the host machine as a sequence of characters whose 
            encoding depends on the TOE and the underlying OS. This sequence must be conditioned into a string of bits that is to be used as a KEK that is the same size as the FEK.<br/><br/>
            
            For FCS_CKM_EXT.6.1, the ST author assigns the maximum size of the password/passphrase it supports; it must support at least 64 characters.<br/><br/>
            
            For FCS_CKM_EXT.6.2, the ST author assigns any other supported characters; if there are no other supported characters, 
            they should select “no other characters”.<br/><br/>
            
            For FCS_CKM_EXT.6.3, the ST author selects the parameters based on the PBKDF used by the TSF. The key cryptographic
            key sizes in FCS_CKM_EXT.6.3 are made to correspond to the KEK key sizes selected in FCS_KYC_EXT.1.<br/><br/>
            
            The password/passphrase must be conditioned into a string of bits that forms the submask to be used as input into the
            KEK. Conditioning is performed using one of the identified hash functions in accordance with the process described in
            NIST SP 800-132. SP 800-132 requires the use of a pseudo-random function (PRF) consisting of HMAC with an approved hash function.<br/><br/>
            
            Appendix A of SP 800-132 recommends setting the iteration count in order to increase the computation needed to derive
            a key from a password and, therefore, increase the workload of performing a password recovery attack. However, for this PP-Module,
            a minimum iteration count of 4096 is required in order to ensure that twelve bits of security is added to the password/passphrase value.
            A significantly higher value is recommended to ensure optimal security.<br/><br/>
            
            For FCS_CKM_EXT.6.4 If the minimum password length is settable, then ST author chooses “a value settable by the administrator
            for this component for FMT_SMF.1.1(2). If the minimum length
            is not settable, the ST author fills in the assignment with the minimum length the password must be (zero-length passwords are not allowed for compliant TOEs).  
          
            <br/><br/>This requirement is selection dependent on FIA_AUT_EXT.1.1.</span></div>

            <div class='eacategory'>TSS</div> There are two aspects of this component that require
              evaluation: passwords/passphrases of the length specified in the requirement (at least
              64 characters) are supported, and that the characters that are input are subject to the
              selected conditioning function. These activities are separately addressed in the text
              below. 
              
              <br/><br/>Support for minimum length: The evaluator shall check to ensure that the 
              TSS describes the allowable ranges for password/passphrase lengths, and that at least 64 characters may be specified by the user.
              
              
              <br/><br/>Support for character set: The evaluator shall check to ensure that the 
              TSS describes the allowable character set and that it contains the characters listed in the SFR.
              
              <br/><br/>Support for PBKDF: The evaluator shall examine the TSS to ensure
              that the formation of all KEKs or FEKs (as decided in the FCS_CKM_EXT.3 selection) is
              described and that the key sizes match that described by the ST author. 
              
              
              <br/><br/>The
              evaluator shall check that the TSS describes the method by which the password/passphrase
              is first encoded and then fed to the SHA algorithm. The settings for the algorithm
              (padding, blocking, etc.) shall be described, and the evaluator shall verify that these
              are supported by the selections in this component as well as the selections concerning
              the hash function itself. The evaluator shall verify that the TSS contains a description
              of how the output of the hash function is used to form the submask that will be input
              into the function and is the same length of the KEK selected in FCS_KYC_EXT.1.
              
              <br/><br/>For the NIST SP 800-132-based conditioning of the password/passphrase, the required
              evaluation activities will be performed when doing the evaluation activities for the
              appropriate requirements (FCS_COP.1.1(4)). If any manipulation of the key is performed
              in forming the submask that will be used to form the FEK or KEK, that process shall be
              described in the TSS. <br/>h:br/&gt;No explicit testing of the formation of the submask from the
              input password is required. 
              
              <br/><br/>FCS_CKM_EXT.6.2: The ST author shall provide a
              description in the TSS regarding the salt generation. The evaluator shall confirm that
              the salt is generated using an RBG described in FCS_RBG_EXT.1 (from the <a href='#bibAppPP'>[AppPP]</a>). <br/><br/>
              
            
            <div class='eacategory'>Guidance</div>
              Support for minimum length: The evaluators shall check the Operational Guidance 
              to determine that there are instructions on how to generate large passwords/passphrases, and
              instructions on how to configure the password/passphrase length 
              to provide entropy commensurate with the keys that the authorization factor is protecting.  <br/><br/>
              
            
            <div class='eacategory'>Tests</div> Support for Password/Passphrase characteristics: In addition to the analysis above, 
              the evaluator shall also perform the following tests on a TOE configured according to the Operational Guidance: <br/>
              <ul>
                <li><b>Test 1: </b>Ensure that the TOE supports passwords/passphrases of a minimum length of 64 characters. </li>
                <li><b>Test 2: </b>Ensure that the TOE does not accept more than the maximum number of characters specified in FCS_CKM_EXT.6.1. </li>
                <li><b>Test 3: </b> Ensure that the TOE does not accept less than the minimum number of characters specified in FCS_CKM_EXT.6.4.
                  If the minimum length is settable by the administrator, the evaluator determines the minimum length or lengths to test.</li>
                <li><b>Test 4: </b> Ensure that the TOE supports passwords consisting of all characters listed in FCS_CKM_EXT.6.2.</li>

          <h1 id='KMD' class='indexable' data-level='A'>Appendix E -  Key Management Description</h1> 
    This appendix should be combined with the appendix in the File Encryption Module if it is also being evaluated.
    
    The documentation of the product’s encryption key management should be detailed enough
    that, after reading, the evaluator will thoroughly understand the product’s key management and
    how it meets the requirements to ensure the keys are adequately protected. This documentation
    should include an essay and diagram(s). This documentation is not required to be part of the
    TSS - it can be submitted as a separate document and marked as developer proprietary.
    <br/><br/>
    Essay:
    <br/><br/>
    The essay will provide the following information for all keys in the key chain:
    <br/><br/>
    <li>The purpose of the key</li>
    <li>If the key is stored in non-volatile memory</li>
    <li>How and when the key is protected</li>
    <li>How and when the key is derived</li>
    <li>The strength of the key</li>
    <li>When or if the key would be no longer needed, along with a justification</li>
    <li>How and when a key may be transmitted</li>
    
    <br/><br/>
    The essay will also describe the following topics:
    <br/><br/>
    
    <li>A description of all authorization factors that are supported by the product and how
      each factor is handled, including any conditioning and combining performed.</li>
    
    <li>If validation is implemented, the process for validation shall be described, noting what
      value is used for validation and the process used to perform the validation. It shall
      describe how this process ensures no keys in the key chain are weakened or exposed
      by this process.</li>
    
    <li>The authorization process that leads to the recovery or access by an end user or administrator. This section
      shall detail the key chain used by the product. It shall describe which keys are used in
      the protection of the FEK(s) or KEK(s) and how they meet the encryption or derivation requirements, 
      including the direct chain from the initial
      authorization to the FEK(s) or KEK(s). It shall also include any values that add into that key chain
      or interact with the key chain and the protections that ensure those values do not
      weaken or expose the overall strength of the key chain.</li>
    
    <li>The diagram and essay will clearly illustrate the key hierarchy to ensure that at no
      point the chain could be broken without a cryptographic exhaust or all of the initial
      authorization values and the effective strength of the FEK(s) is maintained throughout
      the key chain.</li>
    
    <li>A description of the data encryption engine, its components, and details about its
      implementation (e.g. initialization of the product, drivers, libraries (if
      applicable), logical interfaces for encryption/decryption, and how resources to be encrypted are identified.
      The description should also include the data flow from the device’s host interface to the device’s persistent media storing the data
      or transmission to and endpoint,
      information on those conditions in which the data bypasses the data encryption engine. The
      description should be detailed enough to verify all platforms ensure that when the
      user enables encryption, the product encrypts all selected resources.</li>
    
    <li>The process for destroying keys when they are no longer needed by describing the
      storage location of all keys and the protection of all keys stored in non-volatile
      memory.</li>
    
    <br/><br/>
    Diagram:
    
    <br/><br/>
    
    <li>The diagram will include all keys from the initial authorization factor(s) to the FEK(s)
      and any keys or values that contribute into the chain. It must list the cryptographic
      strength of each key and indicate how each key along the chain is protected with
      either options from key chaining requirement. The diagram
      should indicate the input used to derive or decrypt each key in the chain.</li>
    
    <li>A functional (block) diagram showing the main components (such as memories and
      processors) the initial steps needed
      for the activities the TOE performs to ensure it encrypts the targeted resources
      when a user or administrator first provisions the product.</li>
