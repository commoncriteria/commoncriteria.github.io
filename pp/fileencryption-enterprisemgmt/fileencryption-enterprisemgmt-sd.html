    to describe the security functionality of a
      file encryption enterprise management in terms of 
    [CC] and to define functional and assurance requirements for them.
    The PP-Module is intended for use with the
    <a href='https://www.niap-ccevs.org/Profile/Info.cfm?PPID=394&amp;id=394'>Application Software Protection Profile</a>.</p><p>This SD is mandatory for evaluations of TOEs that claim conformance to a PP-Configuration that includes the PP-Module for File Encryption Enterprise Management, Version 1.0.
    Although Evaluation Activities are defined mainly for the evaluators to follow, in general they also help Developers to prepare for evaluation by identifying specific requirements for their TOE.
    The specific requirements in Evaluation Activities may in some cases clarify the meaning of Security
    Functional Requirements (SFR), and may identify particular requirements for the content of Security
    Targets (ST) (especially the TOE Summary Specification), user guidance documentation, and possibly
    supplementary information (e.g. for entropy analysis or cryptographic key management architecture).</p><h2 id='structure' class='indexable' data-level='1'>1.2 Structure of the Document</h2><p>Evaluation Activities can be defined for both SFRs and Security Assurance Requirements (SAR),
    which are themselves defined in separate sections of the SD.</p><p>If any Evaluation Activity cannot be successfully completed in an evaluation then
    the overall verdict for the evaluation is a 'fail'.
    In rare cases there may be acceptable reasons why an Evaluation Activity
    may be modified or deemed not applicable for a particular TOE, 
    but this must be approved by the Certification Body for the evaluation.</p><p>In general, if all Evaluation Activities (for both SFRs and SARs) are successfully
    completed in an evaluation then it would be expected that the overall verdict for 
    the evaluation is a ‘pass’.
    To reach a ‘fail’ verdict when the Evaluation Activities have been successfully 
    completed would require a specific justification from the evaluator as to why the 
    Evaluation Activities were not sufficient for that TOE.
    </p><p>Similarly, at the more granular level of Assurance Components, if the Evaluation 
    Activities for an Assurance Component and all of its related SFR Evaluation 
    Activities are successfully completed in an evaluation then it would be expected 
    that the verdict for the Assurance Component is a ‘pass’.
    To reach a ‘fail’ verdict for the Assurance Component when these Evaluation 
    Activities have been successfully completed would require a specific justification 
    from the evaluator as to why the Evaluation Activities were not sufficient for that TOE.

    The following definitions define Technical terms used in this document:
    <table><tr><td>Authorization factor (AF) </td><td>A value that a user knows, has, or is (e.g. password, token, etc.) submitted 
              to the TOE to establish that the user is in the community authorized to access  the requested material.
              </td></tr><tr><td>Entropy Source </td><td>This cryptographic function provides a seed for a random bit generator by
              accumulating the outputs from one or more noise sources. The functionality includes a
              measure of the minimum work required to guess a given output and tests to ensure that
              the noise sources are operating properly. </td></tr><tr><td>Key Sanitization </td><td>A method of sanitizing encrypted data by securely overwriting the key, as described in the key destruction requirement, that was encrypting the data. 
            </td></tr><tr><td>File/Set of files </td><td>The user data that is selected to be encrypted, which can include
              individual file encryption (with a FEK per file) or a set of files encrypted with a
              single FEK. </td></tr><tr><td>File Encryption Key (FEK) </td><td>The key that is used by the encryption algorithm to encrypt the selected
              user data on the host machine. </td></tr><tr><td>Key Chaining</td><td>The method of using multiple layers of encryption keys to protect data. 
              A top layer key encrypts a lower layer key which encrypts the data; this method can have any number of layers.</td></tr><tr><td>Key Encryption Key (KEK) </td><td>The key that is used to encrypt another key. </td></tr><tr><td>Keying Escrow </td><td>The process of exporting a key to an alternate location. </td></tr><tr><td>Keying material </td><td>Key material is commonly known as critical security parameter (CSP) data, and also includes authorization data, nonces, and metadata. </td></tr><tr><td>Key Release Key </td><td>A key used to release another key from storage, it is not used for the direct derivation or decryption of another key. </td></tr><tr><td>Noise Source </td><td>The component of an RBG that contains the non-deterministic,
              entropy-producing activity. </td></tr><tr><td>Non-Volatile Memory</td><td>A type of computer memory that will retain information without power.  </td></tr><tr><td>Powered-Off State </td><td>The device has been shut down. </td></tr><tr><td>Protected Data</td><td>This refers to all files designated by the user for encryption. </td></tr><tr><td>Random Bit Generator (RBG) </td><td>A cryptographic function composed of an entropy source and DRBG that is
              invoked for random bits needed to produce keying material.</td></tr><tr><td>Registration</td><td>The initial process of associating and endpoint and/or user with the server. </td></tr><tr><td>Submask </td><td>A submask is a bit string that can be generated and stored in a number of ways. </td></tr><tr><td>System Identity </td><td>A composition of a series of identifiers that may vary, but aim to identity and associate with a specific system.</td></tr></table><h1 id='sfr' class='indexable' data-level='0'>2 Evaluation Activities for SFRs</h1><p>The EAs presented in this section capture the actions the evaluator performs 
    to address technology specific aspects covering specific SARs (e.g. ASE_TSS.1, 
    ADV_FSP.1, AGD_OPE.1, and ATE_IND.1) – this is in addition to the CEM work units 
    that are performed in <a href='#sar_aas' class='dynref'> 6 Evaluation Activities for SARs</a>.</p><p>Regarding design descriptions (designated by the subsections labelled TSS, as 
    well as any required supplementary material that may be treated as proprietary), 
    the evaluator must ensure there is specific information that satisfies the EA. 
    For findings regarding the TSS section, the evaluator’s verdicts will be 
    associated with the CEM work unit ASE_TSS.1-1.
    Evaluator verdicts associated with the supplementary evidence will also be 
    associated with ASE_TSS.1-1, 
    since the requirement to provide such evidence is specified in ASE in the cPP.</p><p>For ensuring the guidance documentation provides sufficient information for 
    the administrators/users as it pertains to SFRs, the evaluator’s verdicts will 
    be associated with CEM work units ADV_FSP.1-7, AGD_OPE.1-4, and AGD_OPE.1-5.</p><p>Finally, the subsection labelled Tests is where the authors have determined 
    that testing of the product in the context of the associated SFR is necessary.
    While the evaluator is expected to develop tests, there may be instances where 
    it is more practical for the developer to construct tests, or where the 
    developer may have existing tests. 
    Therefore, it is acceptable for the evaluator to witness developer-generated 
    tests in lieu of executing the tests. 
    In this case, the evaluator must ensure the developer’s tests are executing both 
    in the manner declared by the developer and as mandated by the EA. 
    The CEM work units that are associated with the EAs specified in this section 
    are: ATE_IND.1-3, ATE_IND.1-4, ATE_IND.1-5, ATE_IND.1-6, and ATE_IND.1-7.</p><h2 class='indexable' data-level='1' id='aa-$App'>2.1 Application Software Protection Profile

                <h4>KMD</h4>   
                The evaluator examines the KMD to ensure it describes how the keys are managed in volatile memory. 
                This description includes details of how each identified key is introduced into volatile memory (e.g. by derivation 
                from user input, or by unwrapping a wrapped key stored in non-volatile memory) and how they are overwritten.<br/><br/>
                
                The evaluator shall check to ensure the KMD lists each type of key that is stored in in non-volatile memory, and 
                identifies how the TOE interacts with the underlying platform to manage keys (e.g., store, retrieve, destroy). 
                The description includes details on the method of how the TOE interacts with the platform, including an identification 
                and description of the interfaces it uses to manage keys (e.g., file system APIs, platform key store APIs).<br/><br/>
                
                The evaluator examines the interface description for each different media type to ensure that the 
                interface supports the selection(s) and description in the KMD.<br/><br/>
                
                If the ST makes use of the open assignment and fills in the type of pattern that is used, the evaluator 
                examines the KMD to ensure it describes how that pattern is obtained and used. The evaluator shall 
                verify that the pattern does not contain any CSPs.<br/><br/>
                
                The evaluator shall check that the KMD identifies any configurations or 
                circumstances that may not strictly conform to the key destruction requirement.<br/><br/>
                
                If the selection "destruction of all KEKs protecting target key, 
                where none of the KEKs protecting the target key are derived" is included the evaluator shall examine the TOE's 
                keychain in the KMD and identify each instance when a key is destroyed by this method. In each instance the evaluator 
                shall verify all keys capable of decrypting the target key are destroyed in accordance with a specified key destruction 
                method in FCS_CKM_EXT.4.1. The evaluator shall verify that all of the keys capable of decrypting the target key are not 
                able to be derived to reestablish the keychain after their destruction. <br/><br/>
                
                The evaluator shall verify the KMD includes a description of the areas where keys and
                key material reside and when the keys and key material are no longer needed.<br/><br/>
                
                The evaluator shall verify the KMD includes a key lifecycle, that includes a description
                where key material reside, how the key material is used, how it is determined that keys
                and key material are no longer needed, and how the material is destroyed once it is not
                needed and that the documentation in the KMD follows FCS_CKM_EXT.4.1 for the
                destruction.<br/><br/>
                
                
              <div class='eacategory'>Guidance</div>There are a variety of concerns that may prevent or delay key destruction in some cases.<br/><br/>
                
                The evaluator shall check that the guidance documentation identifies configurations or circumstances that may 
                not strictly conform to the key destruction requirement, and that this description is consistent with the 
                relevant parts of the TSS and any other relevant Required Supplementary Information.<br/><br/>
                
                The evaluator shall check that the guidance documentation provides guidance on situations where key 
                destruction may be delayed at the physical layer and how such situations can be avoided or mitigated if possible.<br/><br/>
                
                Some examples of what is expected to be in the documentation are provided here. <br/><br/>
                
                When the TOE does not have full access to the physical memory, it is possible that the storage may be implementing 
                wear-leveling and garbage collection. This may create additional copies of the key that are logically inaccessible 
                but persist physically. In this case, to mitigate this the drive should support the TRIM command and implements 
                garbage collection to destroy these persistent copies when not actively engaged in other tasks.<br/><br/>
                
                Drive vendors implement garbage collection in a variety of different ways, as such there is a variable amount of time 
                until data is truly removed from these solutions. There is a risk that data may persist for a longer amount of time 
                if it is contained in a block with other data not ready for erasure. To reduce this risk, the operating system and 
                file system of the OE should support TRIM, instructing the non-volatile memory to erase copies via garbage collection 
                upon their deletion. If a RAID array is being used, only set-ups that support TRIM are utilized. If the drive is 
                connected via PCI-Express, the operating system supports TRIM over that channel.<br/><br/>
                
                The drive should be healthy and contains minimal corrupted data and should be end of lifed before a significant 
                amount of damage to drive health occurs, this minimizes the risk that small amounts of 
                potentially recoverable data may remain in damaged areas of the drive.<br/><br/>

                <ul>
                  <li><b>Test 1: </b>The evaluator shall inspect each cipher text, C, produced by the RSA-OAEP
                    encryption operation of the TOE and make sure it is the correct length, either
                    256 or 384 bytes depending on RSA key size. The evaluator shall also feed into
                    the TOE's RSA-OEAP decryption operation some cipher texts that are the
                    wrong length and verify that the erroneous input is detected and that the
                    decryption operation exits with an error code.
                  </li><li><b>Test 2: </b>The evaluator shall convert each cipher text, C, produced by the RSA-OAEP
                    encryption operation of the TOE to the correct cipher text integer, c, and use the
                    decryption primitive to compute em = RSADP((n,d),c) and convert em to the
                    encoded message EM. The evaluator shall then check that the first byte of EM
                    is 0x00. The evaluator shall also feed into the TOE's RSA-OEAP decryption
                    operation some cipher texts where the first byte of EM was set to a value other
                    than 0x00, and verify that the erroneous input is detected and that the decryption
                    operation exits with an error code.
                  </li><li><b>Test 3: </b>The evaluator shall decrypt each cipher text, C, produced by the RSA-OAEP
                    encryption operation of the TOE using RSADP, and perform the OAEP
                    decoding operation (described in NIST SP 800-56B section 7.2.2.4) to recover
                    HA' || X. For each HA', the evaluator shall take the corresponding A and the
                    specified hash algorithm and verify that HA' = Hash(A). The evaluator
                    shall also force the TOE to perform some RSA-OAEP decryption
                    where the A value is passed incorrectly, and the evaluator shall verify
                    that an error is detected.
                  </li><li><b>Test 4: </b>The evaluator shall check the format of the 'X' string recovered in OAEP.Test.3
                    to ensure that the format is of the form PS || 01 || K, where PS consists of zero or
                    more consecutive 0x00 bytes and K is the transported keying material. The
                    evaluator shall also feed into the TOE's RSA-OEAP decryption
                    operation some cipher texts for which the resulting 'X' strings do not have the
                    correct format (i.e., the leftmost non-zero byte is not 0x01). These incorrectly 
                    formatted 'X' variables shall be detected by the RSA-OEAP decrypt
                    function.
                  </li><li><b>Test 5: </b>The evaluator shall trigger all detectable decryption errors and validate that the
                    returned error codes are the same and that no information is given back to the
                    sender on which type of error occurred. The evaluator shall also validate that no
                    intermediate results from the TOE's receiver-side operations are revealed to the
                    sender.</li></ul><br/>

                    recover the secret value, Z, from C0. The evaluator shall check that the
                    unsigned integer represented by Z is greater than 1 and less than n-1, where n is
                    the modulus of the RSA public key. The evaluator shall construct examples
                    where the cipher text is created with a secret value Z = 1 and make sure the

                    given to the KTS-KEM-KWS decryption operation and verify that a decryption

                <li><b>Test 8: </b>If the TOE provides the capability to disable management of any capability allowed in the EM PP-Module, the evaluator shall devise a test that
                  ensures that each capability which can be disabled has been or can be disabled following guidance provided by the vendor. </li>
                
                <li><b>Test 9: </b>If the TOE provides the capability to manage capabilities in place of the File Encryption Clients, where those administrative capabilities are then disabled in the File Encryption Clients,
                  the evaluator shall devise a test that ensures that each capability which can be disabled in the File Encryption Clients and can be subsequently managed by the EM is tested as follows:

	The App PP includes a number of Evaluation Activities associated with both SFRs and SARs.
	Additionally, the PP-Module includes a number of SFR-based Evaluation Activities 
	that similarly refine the SARs of the Base-PPs.
	The evaluation laboratory will evaluate the TOE against the Base-PP
      
    and supplement that evaluation with the necessary SFRs that are taken from the PP-Module.
