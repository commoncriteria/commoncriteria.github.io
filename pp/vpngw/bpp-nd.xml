      The scope of this Protection Profile (PP) is to
      describe the security functionality of QQQQ products in terms of <xref g="CC"/>
      and to define functional and assurance requirements for such products.
      <choice>An operating system is software that manages computer hardware and software
      resources, and provides common services for application programs. The hardware
      it manages may be <selectables><selectable id="physical">physical</selectable>

          <h:li> And components can be refered to by their name: FQQ_QQQ.1 </h:li>
          <h:li> And so can requirements: FQQ_QQQ.1.1 or by their unique identifier: <xref to="a-unique-id"/></h:li>
 
   	  <h:li> Or you can stop them <no-link>ASLR</no-link> </h:li>
          <h:li> This is how you do a picture:

          <h:li> And this is how you reference it: <xref to="fig-logo"/></h:li>
          <h:li> This is how you do an equation with an arbitrary counter:

	An administrator is responsible for management activities, including setting policies that are 
	applied by the enterprise on the operating system.
	This administrator could be acting remotely through a management server, from which the system
	receives configuration policies.
	An administrator can enforce settings on the system which cannot be overridden by non-administrator users.

      <term full="Data Execution Prevention" abbr="DEP">
	An anti-exploitation feature of modern operating systems executing on
	modern computer hardware, which enforces a non-execute permission on pages of memory.
	DEP prevents pages of memory from containing both data and instructions, which makes
	it more difficult for an attacker to introduce and execute code.

	A class of OSes designed to support a wide-variety of workloads consisting of many concurrent applications or services.
	Typical characteristics for OSes in this class include support for third-party applications,
	support for multiple users, and security separation between users and their respective resources.
	General Purpose Operating Systems also lack the real-time constraint that defines Real Time Operating Systems (RTOS).
	RTOSes typically power routers, switches, and embedded devices.

                            The intent of the audit requirement for FDP_PPR_EXT.1 is to log that the VM is connected to a physical device (when the device becomes part of the VM’s hardware view), not to log every time that the device is accessed. Generally, this is only once at VM startup. However, some devices can be connected and disconnected during operation (e.g., virtual USB devices such as CD-ROMs). All such connection/disconnection events must be logged.

                                having the TOE generate audit records for the events listed and administrative actions. 
                                For administrative actions, the evaluator shall test that each action determined by the evaluator above to 
                                be security relevant in the context of this PP is auditable. When verifying the test results, the

                                administrative guide, and that the fields in each audit record have the proper entries.<h:br></h:br>

      The Security Objectives in 
      <xref to="Security_Objectives"/> were constructed to address threats identified in
      <xref to="Threats"/>. The Security Functional Requirements (SFRs)
      in <xref to="SFRs"/> are a formal instantiation of the Security Objectives. The PP
      identifies the Security Assurance Requirements (SARs) to frame the extent to
      which the evaluator assesses the documentation applicable for the evaluation and performs
      independent testing. <h:br/> This section lists the set of SARs from CC part 3
      that are required in evaluations against this PP. Individual Assurance Activities
      <!--(AAs). Never use these again --> to be performed are specified both in <xref to="SFRs"/>
      as well as in this section. <h:br/> The general model for evaluation of OSs against STs written to conform to this PP is as follows: <h:br/> After the
        ST has been approved for evaluation, the ITSEF will obtain the
        OS, supporting environmental IT, and the administrative/user guides for
      the OS. The ITSEF is expected to perform actions mandated by the Common Evaluation
      Methodology (CEM) for the ASE and ALC SARs. The ITSEF also performs the Assurance Activities
      contained within <xref to="SFRs"/>, which are intended to be an interpretation of the
      other CEM assurance requirements as they apply to the specific technology instantiated in the
      OS. The Assurance Activities that are captured in <xref to="SFRs"/> also provide
      clarification as to what the developer needs to provide to demonstrate the OS is compliant
      with the PP.

          functional specification describes the TSFI. It is not
          necessary to have a formal or complete specification of these interfaces. Additionally,
          because OSs conforming to this PP will necessarily have interfaces to
          the Operational Environment that are not directly invokable by OS
          users, there is little point specifying that such interfaces be described in and of
          themselves since only indirect testing of such interfaces may be possible. For this PP,
          the activities for this family should focus on understanding the interfaces presented in
          the TSS in response to the functional requirements and the interfaces
          presented in the AGD documentation. No additional “functional specification” documentation
          is necessary to satisfy the assurance activities specified. The interfaces that need to be
          evaluated are characterized through the information needed to perform the assurance
          activities listed, rather than as an independent, abstract list.

        family. At the assurance level specified in this PP, testing is based on advertised
        functionality and interfaces with dependency on the availability of design information. One
        of the primary outputs of the evaluation process is the test report as specified in the
        following requirements. <a-component cc-id="ate_ind.1"
          name="Independent Testing – Conformance (ATE_IND.1)"> Testing is performed to confirm the
          functionality described in the TSS as well as the administrative
          (including configuration and operational) documentation provided. The focus of the testing
          is to confirm that the requirements specified in <xref to="SFRs"/> being met,
          although some additional testing is specified for SARs in <xref to="Security_Assurance_Requirements"/>.
	  The
          Assurance Activities identify the additional testing activities associated with these
          components. The evaluator produces a test report documenting the plan for and results of
          testing, as well as coverage arguments focused on the platform/OS
          combinations that are claiming conformance to this PP. Given the scope of the OS and its associated evaluation evidence requirements, this component’s
          assurance activities are covered by the assurance activities listed for ALC_CMC.1.

              <aactivity>The evaluator will prepare a test plan and report documenting the testing
              aspects of the system, including any application crashes during testing. The evaluator
              shall determine the root cause of any application crashes and include that information
              in the report. The test plan covers all of the testing actions contained in the
	      <xref to="bibCEM"/> and the body of this PP’s Assurance Activities. <h:br/> While it is
              not necessary to have one test case per test listed in an Assurance Activity, the
              evaluator must document in the test plan that each applicable testing requirement in
              the ST is covered. The test plan identifies the platforms to be
              tested, and for those platforms not included in the test plan but included in the
                ST, the test plan provides a justification for not testing the
              platforms. This justification must address the differences between the tested
              platforms and the untested platforms, and make an argument that the differences do not
              affect the testing to be performed. It is not sufficient to merely assert that the
              differences have no affect; rationale must be provided. If all platforms claimed in
              the ST are tested, then no rationale is necessary. The test plan
              describes the composition of each platform to be tested, and any setup that is
              necessary beyond what is contained in the AGD documentation. It should be noted that
              the evaluator is expected to follow the AGD documentation for installation and setup
              of each platform either as part of a test or as a standard pre-test condition. This
              may include special test drivers or tools. For each driver or tool, an argument (not
              just an assertion) should be provided that the driver or tool will not adversely
              affect the performance of the functionality by the OS and its
              platform. <h:br/> This also includes the configuration of the cryptographic engine to be
              used. The cryptographic algorithms implemented by this engine are those specified by
              this PP and used by the cryptographic protocols being evaluated (IPsec, TLS). The test
              plan identifies high-level test objectives as well as the test procedures to be
              followed to achieve those objectives. These procedures include expected results. <h:br/>
              The test report (which could just be an annotated version of the test plan) details
              the activities that took place when the test procedures were executed, and includes
              the actual results of the tests. This shall be a cumulative account, so if there was a
              test run that resulted in a failure; a fix installed; and then a successful re-run of
              the test, the report would show a “fail” and “pass” result (and the supporting
              details), and not just the “pass” result.</aactivity>

      <section id="ava" title="Class AVA: Vulnerability Assessment">For the first generation of

        penetration tools are created and uniformly distributed to the evaluation labs, the
