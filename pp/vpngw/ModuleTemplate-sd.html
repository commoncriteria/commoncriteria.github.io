    PP-Module for Widgets is
    to describe the security functionality of 
      Widgets products in terms of 
    [CC] and to define functional and assurance requirements for them.

    
    The PP-Module is intended for use with the following Base-PPs:
        <ul><li><a href="">
    Protection Profile for Virtualization Systems, Version </a></li><li><a href="">
    Protection Profile for Network Devices, Version 2.1</a></li></ul><br/>
    This SD is mandatory for evaluations of TOEs that claim conformance to a PP-Configuration that includes the PP-Module for :
    <ul><li>Widgets, Version 1.0</li></ul>
    As such it defines Evaluation Activities for the functionality described in the PP-Module as well as any impacts to the Evaluation Activites to the Base-PP(s) it modifies.
    </p><p> 
Although Evaluation Activities are defined mainly for the evaluators to follow, in general they also help developers to prepare for evaluation by identifying specific requirements for their TOE.
    The specific requirements in Evaluation Activities may in some cases clarify the meaning of Security
    Functional Requirements (SFR), and may identify particular requirements for the content of Security
    Targets (ST) (especially the TOE Summary Specification), user guidance documentation, and possibly
    supplementary information (e.g. for entropy analysis or cryptographic key management architecture).</p><h2 id="structure" class="indexable" data-level="1">1.2 Structure of the Document</h2><p>Evaluation Activities can be defined for both SFRs and Security Assurance Requirements (SAR),
    which are themselves defined in separate sections of the SD.</p><p>If any Evaluation Activity cannot be successfully completed in an evaluation, then
    the overall verdict for the evaluation is a 'fail'.
    In rare cases there may be acceptable reasons why an Evaluation Activity
    may be modified or deemed not applicable for a particular TOE, 
    but this must be approved by the Certification Body for the evaluation.</p><p>In general, if all Evaluation Activities (for both SFRs and SARs) are successfully
    completed in an evaluation then it would be expected that the overall verdict for 
    the evaluation is a ‘pass’.
    To reach a ‘fail’ verdict when the Evaluation Activities have been successfully 
    completed would require a specific justification from the evaluator as to why the 
    Evaluation Activities were not sufficient for that TOE.
    </p><p>Similarly, at the more granular level of assurance components, if the Evaluation 
    Activities for an assurance component and all of its related SFR Evaluation 
    Activities are successfully completed in an evaluation then it would be expected 
    that the verdict for the assurance component is a ‘pass’.
    To reach a ‘fail’ verdict for the assurance component when these Evaluation 
    Activities have been successfully completed would require a specific justification 
    from the evaluator as to why the Evaluation Activities were not sufficient for that TOE.

    to address technology specific aspects covering specific SARs (e.g. ASE_TSS.1, 
    ADV_FSP.1, AGD_OPE.1, and ATE_IND.1) – this is in addition to the CEM workunits 
    that are performed in Section <a href="#sar_aas" class="dynref"> 3 Evaluation Activities for SARs</a>.</p><p>Regarding design descriptions (designated by the subsections labelled TSS, as 
    well as any required supplementary material that may be treated as proprietary), 
    the evaluator must ensure there is specific information that satisfies the EA. 
    For findings regarding the TSS section, the evaluator’s verdicts will be 
    associated with the CEM workunit ASE_TSS.1-1.
    Evaluator verdicts associated with the supplementary evidence will also be 
    associated with ASE_TSS.1-1, 
    since the requirement to provide such evidence is specified in ASE in the PP.</p><p>For ensuring the guidance documentation provides sufficient information for 
    the administrators/users as it pertains to SFRs, the evaluator’s verdicts will 
    be associated with CEM workunits ADV_FSP.1-7, AGD_OPE.1-4, and AGD_OPE.1-5.</p><p>Finally, the subsection labelled Tests is where the authors have determined 
    that testing of the product in the context of the associated SFR is necessary.
    While the evaluator is expected to develop tests, there may be instances where 
    it is more practical for the developer to construct tests, or where the 
    developer may have existing tests. 
    Therefore, it is acceptable for the evaluator to witness developer-generated 
    tests in lieu of executing the tests. 
    In this case, the evaluator must ensure the developer’s tests are executing both 
    in the manner declared by the developer and as mandated by the EA. 
    The CEM workunits that are associated with the EAs specified in this section 
    are: ATE_IND.1-3, ATE_IND.1-4, ATE_IND.1-5, ATE_IND.1-6, and ATE_IND.1-7.</p><h2 class="indexable" data-level="1" id="aa-vir">2.1

            Some really good reasons 
            
              The TSF shall protect TSF data from disclosure and detect its modification when it is transmitted between separate parts of the TOE through the use of 
                  IPsec
                  SSH
                  TLS
                  TLS/HTTPS
                . 
              
                FPT_ITT.1 is optional in NDcPP, however, since a WIDS/WIPS TOE is distributed,
                FPT_ITT.1 shall be included in the ST as modified in this PP-Module and is
                applicable to the data transmitted between the sensors and controller.
                This requirement ensures all communications between components of a distributed TOE
                is protected through the use of an encrypted communications channel. The data passed
                in this trusted communication channel are encrypted as defined in the protocol
                chosen in the selection. The ST author chooses the mechanisms supported by the TOE,
                and then ensures that the detailed protocol requirements in Appendix B of NDcPP
                corresponding to their selection are included in the ST, if not already present.

                IPsec
                SSH
                TLS
                HTTPS
               to provide a trusted communication channel between itself and
                authorized IT entities supporting the following capabilities: audit server, 
                  database server
                  other capabilities
                  no other capabilities
                 that is logically distinct from other communication channels
                and provides assured identification of its end points and protection of the channel
                data from disclosure and detection of modification of the channel data.
              
              
            
            
              The TSF shall permit the TSF or the authorized IT
                entities to initiate communication via the trusted channel.
            
            
              
                The TSF shall initiate communication via the trusted channel for list of services for which the TSF is able to initiate communications.
              
                 
                The intent of the above requirement is to provide a means by which a cryptographic protocol may be used to
                protect external communications with authorized IT entities that the TOE interacts
                with to perform its functions. The TOE uses at least one of the listed protocols for
                communications with the server that collects the audit information. 
                
                If the TSF uses a separate database server, the database server selection must
                included in the ST. 
                
                If other authorized IT entities are protected, the
                ST author makes the appropriate assignments (for those entities) and selections (for
                the protocols that are used to protect those connections). The ST author selects the
                mechanism or mechanisms supported by the TOE, and then ensures that the detailed
