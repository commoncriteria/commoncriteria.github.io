		<!-- This section sets the context for not only the ESR, but what is 
			expected of the resulting Protection Profile (PP). The intent is 
			that the remaining sections provide succinct statements that 
			highlight the relevant aspects to be addressed by the Technical 
			Community (TC) constructing the PP. Here, the authors provide a 
			narrative that introduces the reader to the problem being solved, 
			and presents key aspects that support or guide the TC, and may
			elaborate on subtleties not apparent in the “bulleted” high level
			statements.
		-->
		Secure Shell (SSH) is an encrypted network protocol for initiating shell sessions
		between a client and a server. An SSH session allows a user to interact with the remote system
		via a text-based shell. Typically SSH is used to perform privileged tasks on 
		remote machines.
		<br xmlns="http://common-criteria.rhcloud.com/ns/esr"></br>
		This essential security requirements (ESR) document outlines the high-level
		security requirements for an SSH Client or Server, which will be expressed in a Common Criteria 
		Extended Package (EP). These requirements address threats within a scope established 
		by use cases and environment assumptions. 
		<br xmlns="http://common-criteria.rhcloud.com/ns/esr"></br>
		The security functionality must be realistic and achievable by commercially available 
		products. The resulting EP will also include objective and repeatable evaluation activities, 
		so that evaluations can be executed in a timely manner.
		<br xmlns="http://common-criteria.rhcloud.com/ns/esr"></br>
		With regard to evaluation scope, the SSH Client or Server is composed of the software 
		that is delivered to the end user. 
		This Extended Package is envisioned for combination with base PPs in the following ways:
		<ul xmlns="http://common-criteria.rhcloud.com/ns/esr">
		<li>A standalone SSH product would be covered by this EP
		extending the Application Software Protection Profile.
		</li>
		<li>
		SSH Client or Server software included as part of an Operating
		System or Mobile Device would be covered by this EP extending the
		General Purpose Operating System PP or Mobile
		Device Fundamentals PP, respectively. 
		</li>
		</ul>

			<li> Network eavesdropping, in which an attacker may monitor and gain access to data

		<!--
        	This is where the authors present an initial set of English 
        	requirements that specify security functionality, rather than 
        	design and/or implementation characteristics. These requirements 
        	will provide the foundation for which the detailed set of 
        	requirements is derived. It is important that the requirements 
        	captured here make an attempt to fully address the categories 
        	(e.g., access control, identification and authentication, 
        	management capabilities, roles of administration, secure 
        	communications, and audit). That's not to say the requirements are 
        	fully specified or detailed enough to simply translate to Common 
        	Criteria security functional requirements. The goal is that there 
        	is enough information contained here, as well as the other sections
        	of this document, to provide the TC enough information to ensure 
        	they have an understanding of what is minimally required in breath.

		<p xmlns="http://common-criteria.rhcloud.com/ns/esr"> The following are the essential security requirements expected to be implemented by an

					<ul>
					  <li>aes128-cbc</li>

		<!--
			Simply put, this section presents the aspects of the product and

			This is where the authors explicitly state things they do not want 
			to be considered for inclusion in an evaluation against a 
			resulting PP.  Items expressed here could include threats, 
			functions or capabilities that would require assurance activities 
			that are too subjective, or specific expertise not available in the
			evaluation facilities expected to assess products against the PP 
			(e.g., assessing anti-tamper measures). 
		-->
		The following list contains items that are explicitly out-of-scope for any evaluation
		against an SSH Client or Server <ul xmlns="http://common-criteria.rhcloud.com/ns/esr">
			<li>Malicious, Highly-Privileged Administrators - Highly-privileged administrators
				acting maliciously can disable most, if not all, security protections.
				Additionally procedural controls that are out of scope of this document should be
				considered to help highlight administrator accounts acting suspiciously.</li>
			<li>Zero Days - The disclosure of recently published vulnerabilities (Zero Days) should
				not be used as a reason to fail an SSH Client or Server undergoing evaluation.</li>
			<li>Unofficial Versions - Non-vendor supplied install images often contain added
				functionality and may weaken the normal operating functionality of the 
				SSH Client or Server.</li>
