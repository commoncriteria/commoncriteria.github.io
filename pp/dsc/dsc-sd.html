    to describe the security functionality of 
      Dedicated Security Components products in terms of 
    [CC] and to define functional and assurance requirements for them.

    </p><p> 
Although Evaluation Activities are defined mainly for the evaluators to follow, in general they also help developers to prepare for evaluation by identifying specific requirements for their TOE.
    The specific requirements in Evaluation Activities may in some cases clarify the meaning of Security
    Functional Requirements (SFR), and may identify particular requirements for the content of Security
    Targets (ST) (especially the TOE Summary Specification), user guidance documentation, and possibly
    supplementary information (e.g. for entropy analysis or cryptographic key management architecture).</p><h2 id="structure" class="indexable" data-level="1">1.2 Structure of the Document</h2><p>Evaluation Activities can be defined for both SFRs and Security Assurance Requirements (SAR),
    which are themselves defined in separate sections of the SD.</p><p>If any Evaluation Activity cannot be successfully completed in an evaluation, then
    the overall verdict for the evaluation is a 'fail'.
    In rare cases there may be acceptable reasons why an Evaluation Activity
    may be modified or deemed not applicable for a particular TOE, 
    but this must be approved by the Certification Body for the evaluation.</p><p>In general, if all Evaluation Activities (for both SFRs and SARs) are successfully
    completed in an evaluation then it would be expected that the overall verdict for 
    the evaluation is a ‘pass’.
    To reach a ‘fail’ verdict when the Evaluation Activities have been successfully 
    completed would require a specific justification from the evaluator as to why the 
    Evaluation Activities were not sufficient for that TOE.
    </p><p>Similarly, at the more granular level of assurance components, if the Evaluation 
    Activities for an assurance component and all of its related SFR Evaluation 
    Activities are successfully completed in an evaluation then it would be expected 
    that the verdict for the assurance component is a ‘pass’.
    To reach a ‘fail’ verdict for the assurance component when these Evaluation 
    Activities have been successfully completed would require a specific justification 
    from the evaluator as to why the Evaluation Activities were not sufficient for that TOE.

    to address technology specific aspects covering specific SARs (e.g. ASE_TSS.1, 
    ADV_FSP.1, AGD_OPE.1, and ATE_IND.1) – this is in addition to the CEM work units 
    that are performed in Section <a href="#sar_aas" class="dynref"> 3 Evaluation Activities for SARs</a>.</p><p>Regarding design descriptions (designated by the subsections labelled TSS, as 
    well as any required supplementary material that may be treated as proprietary), 
    the evaluator must ensure there is specific information that satisfies the EA. 
    For findings regarding the TSS section, the evaluator’s verdicts will be 
    associated with the CEM work unit ASE_TSS.1-1.
    Evaluator verdicts associated with the supplementary evidence will also be 
    associated with ASE_TSS.1-1, 
    since the requirement to provide such evidence is specified in ASE in the PP.</p><p>For ensuring the guidance documentation provides sufficient information for 
    the administrators/users as it pertains to SFRs, the evaluator’s verdicts will 
    be associated with CEM work units ADV_FSP.1-7, AGD_OPE.1-4, and AGD_OPE.1-5.</p><p>Finally, the subsection labelled Tests is where the authors have determined 
    that testing of the product in the context of the associated SFR is necessary.
    While the evaluator is expected to develop tests, there may be instances where 
    it is more practical for the developer to construct tests, or where the 
    developer may have existing tests. 
    Therefore, it is acceptable for the evaluator to witness developer-generated 
    tests in lieu of executing the tests. 
    In this case, the evaluator must ensure the developer’s tests are executing both

					<div class="eacategory">Tests</div>
						The following tests require the developer to provide access to a test platform that
						provides the evaluator with tools that are typically not found on factory products.<p></p>
						<b>AK1: RSA Key Generation</b><br/>
						The below tests are derived from The 186-4 RSA Validation System (RSA2VS),
						Updated 8 July 2014, Section 6.2, from the National Institute of Standards and
						Technology.<p></p>
						The evaluator shall verify the implementation of RSA Key Generation by the TOE
						using the Key Generation test. This test verifies the ability of the TSF to correctly
						produce values for the key components including the public verification exponent
						e, the private prime factors p and q, the public modulus n and the calculation of the
						private signature exponent d.<p></p>
						FIPS 186-4 Key Pair generation specifies 5 methods for generating the primes p
						and q.<p></p>
						These are:<ol type="1">
							<li>Random Primes:<ul>
								<li>Provable primes</li>
								<li>Probable primes</li></ul></li>
							<li>Primes with Conditions:<ul>
								<li>Primes p1, p2, q1, q2, p and q shall all be provable primes.</li>
								<li>Primes p1, p2, q1, and q2 shall be provable primes and p and q shall be
									probable primes</li>
								<li>Primes p1, p2, q1, q2, p and q shall all be probable primes.</li></ul></li>
						</ol>	
						To test the key generation method for the Random Provable primes method and for
						all the Primes with Conditions methods, the evaluator must seed the TSF key
						generation routine with sufficient data to deterministically generate the RSA key
						pair.<p></p>
						For each key length supported, the evaluator shall have the TSF generate 25 key
						pairs. The evaluator shall verify the correctness of the TSF’s implementation by
						comparing values generated by the TSF with those generated by a known good
						implementation using the same input parameters.<p></p>
						If the TOE generates Random Probable Primes then if possible, the Random
						Probable primes method should also be verified against a known good
						implementation as described above. If verification against a known good
						implementation is not possible, the evaluator shall have the TSF generate 25 key
						pairs for each supported key length nlen and verify that all of the following are true:<ul>
						<li>n = p*q</li>
						<li>p and q are probably prime according to Miller-Rabin tests with error
							probability &lt;2^(-125)</li>
						<li>2^16 &lt; e &lt; 2^256 and e is an odd integer</li>
						<li>GCD(p-1,e) = 1</li>
						<li>GCD(q-1,e) = 1</li>
						<li>|p-q| &gt; 2^(nlen/2 - 100)</li>
						<li>p &gt;= squareroot(2)*( 2^(nlen/2 -1) )</li>
						<li>q &gt;= squareroot(2)*( 2^(nlen/2 -1) )</li>
						<li>2^(nlen/2) &lt; d &lt; LCM(p-1,q-1)</li>
						<li>e*d = 1 mod LCM(p-1,q-1)</li></ul><p></p>
						<b>AK2 &amp; AK3: ECC Key Generation with NIST and Brainpool Curves</b><p></p>
						These tests are derived from The FIPS 186-4 Elliptic Curve Digital Signature
						Algorithm Validation System (ECDSA2VS), Updated 18 Mar 2014, Section 6.<p></p>
						<b>ECC Key Generation Test</b><p></p>
						For each selected curve, and for each key pair generation method as described in
						FIPS 186-4, section B.4, the evaluator shall require the implementation under test
						to generate 10 private/public key pairs (d, Q). The private key, d, shall be generated 
						using a random bit generator as specified in FCS_RBG_EXT.1. The private key, d,
						is used to compute the public key, Q’. The evaluator shall confirm that 0&lt;d&lt;n
						(where n is the order of the group), and the computed value Q’ is then compared to
						the generated public/private key pairs’ public key, Q, to confirm that Q is equal to
						Q’.<p></p>
						<b>Public Key Validation (PKV) Test</b><p></p>
						For each supported curve, the evaluator shall generate 12 private/public key pairs
						using the key generation function of a known good implementation and modify six
						of the public key values so that they are incorrect, leaving six values unchanged
						(i.e., correct). To determine correctness, the evaluator shall submit the 12 key pairs
						to the public key validation (PKV) function of the TOE and shall confirm that the
						results correspond as expected to the modified and unmodified values.<p></p>
						<b>AK4: DSA Key Generation using Finite-Field Cryptography (FFC)</b><p></p>
						The evaluator shall verify the implementation of the Parameters Generation and the
						Key Generation for FFC by the TOE using the Parameter Generation and Key
						Generation test. This test verifies the ability of the TSF to correctly produce values
						for the field prime p, the cryptographic prime q (dividing p-1), the cryptographic
						group generator g, and the calculation of the private key x and public key y.<p></p>
						The Parameter generation specifies 2 ways (or methods) to generate the
						cryptographic prime q and the field prime p:<ul>
							<li>Primes q and p shall both be provable primes</li>
							<li>Primes q and field prime p shall both be probable primes</li></ul>
						and two ways to generate the cryptographic group generator g:<ul>
							<li>Generator g constructed through a verifiable process</li>
							<li>Generator g constructed through an unverifiable process.</li></ul>
						The Key generation specifies 2 ways to generate the private key x:<ul>
							<li>len(q) bit output of RBG where 1 ≤ x ≤ q-1</li>
							<li>len(q) + 64 bit output of RBG, followed by a mod q-1 operation and a +1
								operation, where 1≤ x≤q-1. </li></ul>
						The security strength of the RBG must be at least that of the security offered by the
						FFC parameter set.<p></p>
						To test the cryptographic and field prime generation method for the provable primes
						method or the group generator g for a verifiable process, the evaluator must seed
						the TSF parameter generation routine with sufficient data to deterministically
						generate the parameter set.<p></p>
						For each key length supported, the evaluator shall have the TSF generate 25
						parameter sets and key pairs. The evaluator shall verify the correctness of the TSF’s
						implementation by comparing values generated by the TSF with those generated
						from a known good implementation. Verification must also confirm<ul>
						<li>g != 0,1</li>
						<li>q divides p-1</li>
						<li>g^q mod p = 1</li>
						<li>g^x mod p = y</li></ul>
						for each FFC parameter set and key pair.<p></p>
						<b>AK5: Curve25519 Key Generation</b><p></p>
						The evaluator shall require the implementation under test (IUT) to generate 10
						private/public key pairs. The private key shall be generated as specified in RFC
						7748 using an approved random bit generator (RBG) and shall be written in littleendian order (least significant byte first. To determine correctness, the evaluator
						shall submit the generated key pairs to the public key verification (PKV) function
						of a known good implementation.<p></p>
						Note: Assuming the PKV function of the good implementation will (using little-endian order):
						<ul>
							<li>Confirm the private and public keys are 32-byte values</li>
							<li>Confirm the three least significant bits of the first byte of the private key are
								zero</li>
							<li>Confirm the most significant bit of the last byte is zero</li>
							<li>Confirm the second most significant bit of the last byte is one</li>
							<li>Calculate the expected public key from the private key and confirm it matches
								the supplied public key</li>
						</ul>
						The evaluator shall generate 10 private/public key pairs using the key generation
						function of a known good implementation and modify 5 of the public key values so
						that they are incorrect, leaving five values unchanged (i.e. correct). The evaluator
						shall obtain in response a set of 10 PASS/FAIL values.

						[conditional] If the KEK is generated according to an asymmetric key scheme, the

						[conditional] If the KEK is generated according to a symmetric key scheme, the

					</div><div class="comp" id=""><h4>FCS_CKM.4 Cryptographic Key Destruction</h4>
				
				
				
				
		<div class="eacategory">TSS</div>
					The evaluator shall examine the TSS to ensure it lists all relevant keys and keying
					material (describing the source of the data, all memory types in which the data is
					stored (covering storage both during and outside of a session, and both plaintext and
					non-plaintext forms of the data)), all relevant destruction situations (including the
					point in time at which the destruction occurs; e.g. factory reset or device wipe
					function, change of authorization data, change of DEK, completion of use of an
					intermediate key) and the destruction method used in each case. The evaluator shall
					confirm that the description of the data and storage locations is consistent with the
					functions carried out by the TOE (e.g. that all keys in the key chain are accounted
					for). (Where keys are stored encrypted or wrapped under another key then this may need to
					be explained in order to allow the evaluator to confirm the consistency of the description 
					of keys with the TOE functions). <p></p>
					The evaluator shall check that the TSS identifies any configurations or
					circumstances that may not conform to the key destruction requirement (see further
					discussion in the AGD section below). Note that reference may be made to the AGD
					for description of the detail of such cases where destruction may be prevented or
					delayed.<p></p>
					Where the ST specifies the use of “a value that does not contain any sensitive data”
					to overwrite keys, the evaluator shall examine the TSS to ensure that it describes
					how that pattern is obtained and used, and that this justifies the claim that the pattern
					does not contain any sensitive data. <p></p>
				<div class="eacategory">Guidance</div>
					The evaluator shall check that the guidance documentation for the TOE requires
					users to ensure that the TOE remains under the user’s control while a session is
					active.<p></p>
					A TOE may be subject to situations that could prevent or delay data destruction in
					some cases. The evaluator shall check that the guidance documentation identifies
					configurations or circumstances that may not strictly conform to the key destruction
					requirement, and that this description is consistent with the relevant parts of the TSS
					(and KMD). The evaluator shall check that the guidance documentation provides
					guidance on situations where key destruction may be delayed at the physical layer,
					identifying any additional mitigation actions for the user (e.g. there might be some
					operation the user can invoke, or the user might be advised to retain control of the
					device for some particular time to maximise the probability that garbage collection
					will have occurred).<p></p>
					For example, when the TOE does not have full access to the physical memory, it is
					possible that the storage may implement wear-levelling and garbage collection. This
					may result in additional copies of the data that are logically inaccessible but persist
					physically. Where available, the TOE might then describe use of the TRIM
					command	and garbage collection to destroy these persistent copies upon their
					deletion (this would be explained in TSS and guidance documentation). <p></p>
					Where TRIM is used then the TSS or guidance documentation is also expected to describe how
					the keys are stored such that they are not inaccessible to TRIM, (e.g. they would need not
					to be contained in a file less than 982 bytes which would be completely contained in the
					master file table.<p></p>
				<div class="eacategory">KMD</div>
						The evaluator shall examine the KMD to verify that it identifies and describes the
						interfaces that are used to service commands to read/write memory. The evaluator
						shall examine the interface description for each different media type to ensure that
						the interface supports the selections made by the ST author.<p></p>
						45 The evaluator shall examine the KMD to ensure that all keys and keying material
						identified in the TSS and KMD have been accounted for.<p></p>
						46 Note that where selections include ‘destruction of reference to the key directly
						followed by a request for garbage collection’ (for volatile memory) then the
						evaluator shall examine the KMD to ensure that it explains the nature of the
						destruction of the reference, the request for garbage collection, and of the garbage
						collection process itself.<p></p>
				<div class="eacategory">Tests</div>
					The following tests require the developer to provide access to a test platform that
					provides the evaluator with tools that are typically not found on factory products.<p></p>
					The evaluator shall perform the following tests:
					<ul>
						<li><b>Test 1: </b>
							Applied to each key or keying material held as plaintext in volatile
							memory and subject to destruction by overwrite by the TOE (whether or not the
							plaintext value is subsequently encrypted for storage in volatile or non-volatile
							memory).<p></p>
							The evaluator shall:<ol type="1">
							<li>Record the value of the key or keying material.</li>
							<li>Cause the TOE to dump the SDO/SDE memory of the TOE into a binary file.</li>
							<li>Search the content of the binary file created in Step #2 to locate all
								instances of the known key value from Step #1.<p></p>
								Note that the primary purpose of Step #3 is to demonstrate that appropriate
								search commands are being used for Steps #8 and #9.</li>
							<li>Cause the TOE to perform normal cryptographic processing with the key
								from Step #1.</li>
							<li>Cause the TOE to destroy the key.</li>
							<li>Cause the TOE to stop execution but not exit.</li>
							<li>Cause the TOE to dump the SDO/SDE memory of the TOE into a binary

							<li>Search the content of the binary file created in Step #7 for instances of the
								known key value from Step #1.</li>
							<li>Break the key value from Step #1 into an evaluator-chosen set of
								fragments and perform a search using each fragment. (Note that the
								evaluator shall first confirm with the developer how the key is normally
								stored, in order to choose fragment sizes that are the same or smaller than
								any fragmentation of the data that may be implemented by the TOE. The
								endianness or byte-order should also be taken into account in the search.)</li>
							</ol><p></p>
							Steps #1-8 ensure that the complete key does not exist anywhere in volatile
							memory. If a copy is found, then the test fails.<p></p>
							Step #9 ensures that partial key fragments do not remain in memory. If the
							evaluator finds a 32-or-greater-consecutive-bit fragment, then fail immediately.
							Otherwise, there is a chance that it is not within the context of a key (e.g., some
							random bits that happen to match). If this is the case the test should be repeated
							with a different key in Step #1. If a fragment is also found in this repeated run
							then the test fails unless the developer provides a reasonable explanation for the
							collision, then the evaluator may give a pass on this test.<p></p>
						</li>
						<li><b>Test 2: </b>
							Applied to each key and keying material held in non-volatile memory and
							subject to destruction by overwrite by the TOE.<ol type="1">
							<li>Record the value of the key or keying material.</li>
							<li>Cause the TOE to perform normal cryptographic processing with the key
								from Step #1.</li>
							<li>Search the non-volatile memory the key was stored in for instances of the
								known key value from Step #1. <p></p>
								Note that the primary purpose of Step #3 is to demonstrate that appropriate
								search commands are being used for Steps #5 and #6.</li>
							<li>Cause the TOE to clear the key.</li>
							<li>Search the non-volatile memory in which the key was stored for instances
								of the known key value from Step #1. If a copy is found, then the test fails.</li>
							<li>Break the key value from Step #1 into an evaluator-chosen set of
								fragments and perform a search using each fragment. (Note that the
								evaluator shall first confirm with the developer how the key is normally
								stored, in order to choose fragment sizes that are the same or smaller than
								any fragmentation of the data that may be implemented by the TOE. The
								endianness or byte-order should also be taken into account in the search).</li>
							</ol>
							Step #6 ensures that partial key fragments do not remain in non-volatile memory.
							If the evaluator finds a 32-or-greater-consecutive-bit fragment, then fail
							immediately. Otherwise, there is a chance that it is not within the context of a key
							(e.g., some random bits that happen to match). If this is the case the test should be
							repeated with a different key in Step #1. If a fragment is also found in this
							repeated run then the test fails unless the developer provides a reasonable
							explanation for the collision, then the evaluator may give a pass on this test.
						</li>
						<li><b>Test 3: </b>
							Applied to each key and keying material held in non-volatile memory and
							subject to destruction by overwrite by the TOE.<ol type="1">
							<li>Record memory of the key or keying material.</li>
							<li>Cause the TOE to perform normal cryptographic processing with the key
								from Step #1.</li>
							<li>Cause the TOE to clear the key. Record the value to be used for the
								overwrite of the key. </li>
							<li>Examine the memory from Step #1 to ensure the appropriate pattern
								(recorded in Step #3) is used. </li>
							</ol>
							The test succeeds if correct pattern is found in the memory location. If the pattern
							is not found, then the test fails.

						For each supported combination of I_length, MAC, salt, PRF, counter location (if
						a counter is used), value of r (if a counter is used), and value of L, the evaluator
						shall generate 10 test vectors that include pseudorandom input values I, and

						<b>KeyDrv4: Intermediate Keys Method</b><p></p>
						If the selected algorithm is a hash then the testing of the hash primitive is the only

						The tests below are derived from the “The Secure Hash Algorithm Validation
						System (SHAVS), Updated: May 21, 2014” from the National Institute of Standards
						and Technology.<p></p>
						The TSF hashing functions can be implemented with one of two orientations. The
						first is a byte-oriented implementation: this hashes messages that are an integral
						number of bytes in length (i.e., the length (in bits) of the message to be hashed is
						divisible by 8). The second is a bit-oriented implementation: this hashes messages
						of arbitrary length. Separate tests for each orientation are given below.<p></p>
						The evaluator shall perform all of the following tests for each hash algorithm and

						<b>Short Messages Test, Bit-oriented Implementation</b><p></p>
						The evaluators devise an input set consisting of m+1 messages, where m is the block

						provided to the TSF.<p></p>
						<b>Selected Long Messages Test, Byte-oriented Implementation</b><p></p>
						The evaluators devise an input set consisting of m/8 messages, where m is the block
						length of the hash algorithm in bits (see SHA Properties Table). The length of the
						ith message is m + 8*99*i, where 1 ≤ i ≤ m/8. The message text shall be pseudorandomly generated. The evaluators compute the message digest for each of the

						<b>Pseudo-randomly Generated Messages Test</b><p></p>
						The evaluators randomly generate a seed that is n bits long, where n is the length of

						For each SHA-3-XXX implementation, XXX represents d, the digest length in bits.
						The capacity, c, is equal to 2d bits. The rate is equal to 1600-c bits.<p></p>
						65 The TSF hashing functions can be implemented with one of two orientations. The
						first is a bit-oriented mode that hashes messages of arbitrary length. The second is
						a byte-oriented mode that hashes messages that are an integral number of bytes in
						length (i.e., the length (in bits) of the message to be hashed is divisible by 8).
						Separate tests for each orientation are given below.<p></p>

						The evaluators devise an input set consisting of 100 long messages ranging in size
						from rate+(rate+1) to rate+(100*(rate+1)), incrementing by rate+1. (For example,
						SHA-3-256 has a rate of 1088 bits. Therefore, 100 messages will be generated with
						lengths 2177, 3266, …, 109988 bits.) The message text shall be pseudo-randomly

						The evaluators devise an input set consisting of 100 messages ranging in size from
						(rate+(rate+8)) to (rate+100*(rate+8)), incrementing by rate+8. (For example,
						SHA-3-256 has a rate of 1088 bits. Therefore 100 messages will be generated of

					The evaluator shall verify the implementation of the key generation routines of the

					<b>If ECDH-NIST or ECDH-BPC is claimed:</b><p></p>
					<b>SP800-56A Key Agreement Schemes</b><p></p>
					The evaluator shall verify a TOE's implementation of SP800-56A key agreement
					schemes using the following Function and Validity tests. These validation tests for
					each key agreement scheme verify that a TOE has implemented the components of
					the key agreement scheme according to the specifications in the Recommendation.
					These components include the calculation of the DLC primitives (the shared secret
					value Z) and the calculation of the derived keying material (DKM) via the Key
					Derivation Function (KDF). If key confirmation is supported, the evaluator shall
					also verify that the components of key confirmation have been implemented
					correctly, using the test procedures described below. This includes the parsing of
					the DKM, the generation of MACdata and the calculation of MACtag.<p></p>
					<i>Function Test</i><p></p>
					The Function test verifies the ability of the TOE to implement the key agreement
					schemes correctly. To conduct this test the evaluator shall generate or obtain test
					vectors from a known good implementation of the TOE supported schemes. For
					each supported key agreement scheme-key agreement role combination, KDF type,
					and, if supported, key confirmation role-key confirmation type combination, the
					tester shall generate 10 sets of test vectors. The data set consists of one set of domain
					parameter values (FFC) or the NIST approved curve (ECC) per 10 sets of public
					keys. These keys are static, ephemeral or both depending on the scheme being
					tested.<p></p>
					The evaluator shall obtain the DKM, the corresponding TOE’s public keys (static
					or ephemeral), the MAC tags, and any inputs used in the KDF, such as the Other
					Information field OI and TOE id fields.<p></p>
					If the TOE does not use a KDF defined in SP 800-56A, the evaluator shall obtain
					only the public keys and the hashed value of the shared secret. <p></p>
					The evaluator shall verify the correctness of the TSF’s implementation of a given
					scheme by using a known good implementation to calculate the shared secret value,
					derive the keying material DKM, and compare hashes or MAC tags generated from
					these values.<p></p>
					If key confirmation is supported, the TSF shall perform the above for each
					implemented approved MAC algorithm.<p></p>
					<i>Validity Test</i><p></p>
					The Validity test verifies the ability of the TOE to recognize another party’s valid
					and invalid key agreement results with or without key confirmation. To conduct this
					test, the evaluator shall obtain a list of the supporting cryptographic functions
					included in the SP800-56A key agreement implementation to determine which
					errors the TOE should be able to recognize. The evaluator generates a set of 24
					(FFC) or 30 (ECC) test vectors consisting of data sets including domain parameter
					values or NIST approved curves, the evaluator’s public keys, the TOE’s
					public/private key pairs, MACTag, and any inputs used in the KDF, such as the
					other info and TOE id fields.<p></p>
					The evaluator shall inject an error in some of the test vectors to test that the TOE
					recognizes invalid key agreement results caused by the following fields being
					incorrect: the shared secret value Z, the DKM, the other information field OI, the
					data to be MACed, or the generated MACTag. If the TOE contains the full or partial
					(only ECC) public key validation, The evaluator shall also individually inject errors
					in both parties’ static public keys, both parties’ ephemeral public keys and the
					TOE’s static private key to assure the TOE detects errors in the public key validation
					function or the partial key validation function (in ECC only). At least two of the test
					vectors shall remain unmodified and therefore should result in valid key agreement
					results (they should pass).<p></p>
					The TOE shall use these modified test vectors to emulate the key agreement scheme
					using the corresponding parameters. The evaluator shall compare the TOE’s results
					with the results using a known good implementation verifying that the TOE detects
					these errors.<p></p>
					<b>If KAS1, KAS2, KTS-OAEP, or RSAES-PKCS1-v1_5 is claimed:</b><p></p>
					<b>SP800-56B and PKCS#1 Key Establishment Schemes</b><p></p>
					If the TOE acts as a sender, the following evaluation activity shall be performed to
					ensure the proper operation of every TOE supported combination of RSA-based
					key establishment scheme:<p></p>
					To conduct this test the evaluator shall generate or obtain test vectors from a known
					good implementation of the TOE supported schemes. For each combination of
					supported key establishment scheme and its options (with or without key
					confirmation if supported, for each supported key confirmation MAC function if
					key confirmation is supported, and for each supported mask generation function if
					KTS-OAEP is supported), the tester shall generate 10 sets of test vectors. Each test
					vector shall include the RSA public key, the plaintext keying material, any
					additional input parameters if applicable, the MacKey and MacTag if key

					evaluator shall perform a key establishment encryption operation on the TOE with
					the same inputs (in cases where key confirmation is incorporated, the test shall use
					the MacKey from the test vector instead of the randomly generated MacKey used
					in normal operation) and ensure that the outputted ciphertext is equivalent to the
					ciphertext in the test vector.<p></p>
					If the TOE acts as a receiver, the following evaluation activities shall be performed
					to ensure the proper operation of every TOE supported combination of RSA-based
					key establishment scheme:<p></p>
					To conduct this test the evaluator shall generate or obtain test vectors from a known
					good implementation of the TOE supported schemes. For each combination of
					supported key establishment scheme and its options (with our without key
					confirmation if supported, for each supported key confirmation MAC function if
					key confirmation is supported, and for each supported mask generation function if
					KTSOAEP is supported), the tester shall generate 10 sets of test vectors. Each test
					vector shall include the RSA private key, the plaintext keying material (KeyData),
					any additional input parameters if applicable, the MacTag in cases where key
					confirmation is incorporated, and the outputted ciphertext. For each test vector, the
					evaluator shall perform the key establishment decryption operation on the TOE and
					ensure that the outputted plaintext keying material (KeyData) is equivalent to the
					plain text keying material in the test vector. In cases where key confirmation is
					incorporated, the evaluator shall perform the key confirmation steps and ensure that
					the outputted MacTag is equivalent to the MacTag in the test vector.<p></p>
					The evaluator shall ensure that the TSS describes how the TOE handles decryption
					errors. In accordance with NIST Special Publication 800-56B, the TOE must not
					reveal the particular error that occurred, either through the contents of any outputted
					or logged error message or through timing variations. If KTS-OAEP is supported,
					the evaluator shall create separate contrived ciphertext values that trigger each of
					the three decryption error checks described in NIST Special Publication 800-56B
					section 7.2.2.3, ensure that each decryption attempt results in an error, and ensure
					that any outputted or logged error message is identical for each.<p></p>

					<b>Curve25519:</b><p></p>
					The evaluator shall verify a TOE's implementation of the key agreement scheme
					using the following Function and Validity tests. These validation tests for each key
					agreement scheme verify that a TOE has implemented the components of the key
					agreement scheme according to the specification. These components include the
					calculation of the shared secret K and the hash of K.<p></p>
					<b>Function Test</b><p></p>
					The Function test verifies the ability of the TOE to implement the key agreement
					schemes correctly. To conduct this test the evaluator shall generate or obtain test
					vectors from a known good implementation of the TOE supported schemes. For
					each supported key agreement role and hash function combination, the tester shall
					generate 10 sets of public keys. These keys are static, ephemeral or both depending
					on the scheme being tested.<p></p>
					The evaluator shall obtain the shared secret value K, and the hash of K. The
					evaluator shall verify the correctness of the TSF’s implementation of a given
					scheme by using a known good implementation to calculate the shared secret value
					K and compare the hash generated from this value.<p></p>
					<b>Validity Test</b><p></p>
					The Validity test verifies the ability of the TOE to recognize another party’s valid
					and invalid key agreement results. To conduct this test, the evaluator generates a set
					of 30 test vectors consisting of data sets including the evaluator’s public keys and
					the TOE’s public/private key pairs.<p></p>
					The evaluator shall inject an error in some of the test vectors to test that the TOE
					recognizes invalid key agreement results caused by the following fields being
					incorrect: the shared secret value K or the hash of K. At least two of the test vectors
					shall remain unmodified and therefore should result in valid key agreement results
					(they should pass).<p></p>
					The TOE shall use these modified test vectors to emulate the key agreement scheme
					using the corresponding parameters. The evaluator shall compare the TOE’s results
					with the results using a known good implementation verifying that the TOE detects
					these errors.<p></p>

			<li>The subject can always perform the desired operation.</li>
			<li>The subject can never perform the desired operation, either because they
				lack sufficient permission or because the TSF includes no interface to

				Given that this SFR requires a large number of potential subject-object-operation

						For each key length supported, the evaluator shall have the TSF generate 25

						shall submit the generated key pairs to the public key verification (PKV) function
						of a known good implementation.<p></p>
						Note: Assuming the PKV function of the good implementation will (using little-endian order):
						<ul>
							<li>Confirm the private and public keys are 32-byte values</li>
							<li>Confirm the three least significant bits of the first byte of the private key are

					</div><div class="comp" id=""><h4>FCS_CKM.4 Cryptographic Key Destruction</h4>
				
				
				
				
		<div class="eacategory">TSS</div>
					The evaluator shall examine the TSS to ensure it lists all relevant keys and keying
					material (describing the source of the data, all memory types in which the data is
					stored (covering storage both during and outside of a session, and both plaintext and
					non-plaintext forms of the data)), all relevant destruction situations (including the
					point in time at which the destruction occurs; e.g. factory reset or device wipe
					function, change of authorization data, change of DEK, completion of use of an
					intermediate key) and the destruction method used in each case. The evaluator shall
					confirm that the description of the data and storage locations is consistent with the
					functions carried out by the TOE (e.g. that all keys in the key chain are accounted
					for). (Where keys are stored encrypted or wrapped under another key then this may need to
					be explained in order to allow the evaluator to confirm the consistency of the description 
					of keys with the TOE functions). <p></p>
					The evaluator shall check that the TSS identifies any configurations or
					circumstances that may not conform to the key destruction requirement (see further
					discussion in the AGD section below). Note that reference may be made to the AGD
					for description of the detail of such cases where destruction may be prevented or
					delayed.<p></p>
					Where the ST specifies the use of “a value that does not contain any sensitive data”
					to overwrite keys, the evaluator shall examine the TSS to ensure that it describes
					how that pattern is obtained and used, and that this justifies the claim that the pattern
					does not contain any sensitive data. <p></p>
				<div class="eacategory">Guidance</div>
					The evaluator shall check that the guidance documentation for the TOE requires
					users to ensure that the TOE remains under the user’s control while a session is
					active.<p></p>
					A TOE may be subject to situations that could prevent or delay data destruction in
					some cases. The evaluator shall check that the guidance documentation identifies
					configurations or circumstances that may not strictly conform to the key destruction
					requirement, and that this description is consistent with the relevant parts of the TSS
					(and KMD). The evaluator shall check that the guidance documentation provides
					guidance on situations where key destruction may be delayed at the physical layer,
					identifying any additional mitigation actions for the user (e.g. there might be some
					operation the user can invoke, or the user might be advised to retain control of the
					device for some particular time to maximise the probability that garbage collection
					will have occurred).<p></p>
					For example, when the TOE does not have full access to the physical memory, it is
					possible that the storage may implement wear-levelling and garbage collection. This
					may result in additional copies of the data that are logically inaccessible but persist
					physically. Where available, the TOE might then describe use of the TRIM
					command	and garbage collection to destroy these persistent copies upon their
					deletion (this would be explained in TSS and guidance documentation). <p></p>
					Where TRIM is used then the TSS or guidance documentation is also expected to describe how
					the keys are stored such that they are not inaccessible to TRIM, (e.g. they would need not
					to be contained in a file less than 982 bytes which would be completely contained in the
					master file table.<p></p>
				<div class="eacategory">KMD</div>
						The evaluator shall examine the KMD to verify that it identifies and describes the
						interfaces that are used to service commands to read/write memory. The evaluator
						shall examine the interface description for each different media type to ensure that
						the interface supports the selections made by the ST author.<p></p>
						45 The evaluator shall examine the KMD to ensure that all keys and keying material
						identified in the TSS and KMD have been accounted for.<p></p>
						46 Note that where selections include ‘destruction of reference to the key directly
						followed by a request for garbage collection’ (for volatile memory) then the
						evaluator shall examine the KMD to ensure that it explains the nature of the
						destruction of the reference, the request for garbage collection, and of the garbage
						collection process itself.<p></p>
				<div class="eacategory">Tests</div>
					The following tests require the developer to provide access to a test platform that
					provides the evaluator with tools that are typically not found on factory products.<p></p>
					The evaluator shall perform the following tests:
					<ul>
						<li><b>Test 1: </b>
							Applied to each key or keying material held as plaintext in volatile
							memory and subject to destruction by overwrite by the TOE (whether or not the
							plaintext value is subsequently encrypted for storage in volatile or non-volatile
							memory).<p></p>
							The evaluator shall:<ol type="1">
							<li>Record the value of the key or keying material.</li>
							<li>Cause the TOE to dump the SDO/SDE memory of the TOE into a binary file.</li>
							<li>Search the content of the binary file created in Step #2 to locate all
								instances of the known key value from Step #1.<p></p>
								Note that the primary purpose of Step #3 is to demonstrate that appropriate
								search commands are being used for Steps #8 and #9.</li>
							<li>Cause the TOE to perform normal cryptographic processing with the key
								from Step #1.</li>
							<li>Cause the TOE to destroy the key.</li>
							<li>Cause the TOE to stop execution but not exit.</li>
							<li>Cause the TOE to dump the SDO/SDE memory of the TOE into a binary
								file.</li>
							<li>Search the content of the binary file created in Step #7 for instances of the
								known key value from Step #1.</li>
							<li>Break the key value from Step #1 into an evaluator-chosen set of
								fragments and perform a search using each fragment. (Note that the
								evaluator shall first confirm with the developer how the key is normally
								stored, in order to choose fragment sizes that are the same or smaller than
								any fragmentation of the data that may be implemented by the TOE. The
								endianness or byte-order should also be taken into account in the search.)</li>
							</ol><p></p>
							Steps #1-8 ensure that the complete key does not exist anywhere in volatile
							memory. If a copy is found, then the test fails.<p></p>
							Step #9 ensures that partial key fragments do not remain in memory. If the
							evaluator finds a 32-or-greater-consecutive-bit fragment, then fail immediately.
							Otherwise, there is a chance that it is not within the context of a key (e.g., some
							random bits that happen to match). If this is the case the test should be repeated
							with a different key in Step #1. If a fragment is also found in this repeated run
							then the test fails unless the developer provides a reasonable explanation for the
							collision, then the evaluator may give a pass on this test.<p></p>
						</li>
						<li><b>Test 2: </b>
							Applied to each key and keying material held in non-volatile memory and
							subject to destruction by overwrite by the TOE.<ol type="1">
							<li>Record the value of the key or keying material.</li>
							<li>Cause the TOE to perform normal cryptographic processing with the key
								from Step #1.</li>
							<li>Search the non-volatile memory the key was stored in for instances of the

								Note that the primary purpose of Step #3 is to demonstrate that appropriate

							<li>Cause the TOE to clear the key.</li>
							<li>Search the non-volatile memory in which the key was stored for instances
								of the known key value from Step #1. If a copy is found, then the test fails.</li>
							<li>Break the key value from Step #1 into an evaluator-chosen set of
								fragments and perform a search using each fragment. (Note that the
								evaluator shall first confirm with the developer how the key is normally
								stored, in order to choose fragment sizes that are the same or smaller than
								any fragmentation of the data that may be implemented by the TOE. The
								endianness or byte-order should also be taken into account in the search).</li>
							</ol>
							Step #6 ensures that partial key fragments do not remain in non-volatile memory.
							If the evaluator finds a 32-or-greater-consecutive-bit fragment, then fail
							immediately. Otherwise, there is a chance that it is not within the context of a key
							(e.g., some random bits that happen to match). If this is the case the test should be
							repeated with a different key in Step #1. If a fragment is also found in this
							repeated run then the test fails unless the developer provides a reasonable
							explanation for the collision, then the evaluator may give a pass on this test.
						</li>
						<li><b>Test 3: </b>
							Applied to each key and keying material held in non-volatile memory and
							subject to destruction by overwrite by the TOE.<ol type="1">
							<li>Record memory of the key or keying material.</li>
							<li>Cause the TOE to perform normal cryptographic processing with the key
								from Step #1.</li>
							<li>Cause the TOE to clear the key. Record the value to be used for the
								overwrite of the key. </li>
							<li>Examine the memory from Step #1 to ensure the appropriate pattern
								(recorded in Step #3) is used. </li>
							</ol>
							The test succeeds if correct pattern is found in the memory location. If the pattern
							is not found, then the test fails.

						and Technology.<p></p>
						The TSF hashing functions can be implemented with one of two orientations. The
						first is a byte-oriented implementation: this hashes messages that are an integral
						number of bytes in length (i.e., the length (in bits) of the message to be hashed is
						divisible by 8). The second is a bit-oriented implementation: this hashes messages

						For each SHA-3-XXX implementation, XXX represents d, the digest length in bits.
						The capacity, c, is equal to 2d bits. The rate is equal to 1600-c bits.<p></p>
						65 The TSF hashing functions can be implemented with one of two orientations. The
						first is a bit-oriented mode that hashes messages of arbitrary length. The second is

						The evaluators devise an input set consisting of 100 long messages ranging in size
						from rate+(rate+1) to rate+(100*(rate+1)), incrementing by rate+1. (For example,
						SHA-3-256 has a rate of 1088 bits. Therefore, 100 messages will be generated with

					<b>If ECDH-NIST or ECDH-BPC is claimed:</b><p></p>
					<b>SP800-56A Key Agreement Schemes</b><p></p>
					The evaluator shall verify a TOE's implementation of SP800-56A key agreement
					schemes using the following Function and Validity tests. These validation tests for
					each key agreement scheme verify that a TOE has implemented the components of
					the key agreement scheme according to the specifications in the Recommendation.
					These components include the calculation of the DLC primitives (the shared secret
					value Z) and the calculation of the derived keying material (DKM) via the Key
					Derivation Function (KDF). If key confirmation is supported, the evaluator shall
					also verify that the components of key confirmation have been implemented
					correctly, using the test procedures described below. This includes the parsing of
					the DKM, the generation of MACdata and the calculation of MACtag.<p></p>
					<i>Function Test</i><p></p>
					The Function test verifies the ability of the TOE to implement the key agreement
					schemes correctly. To conduct this test the evaluator shall generate or obtain test
					vectors from a known good implementation of the TOE supported schemes. For
					each supported key agreement scheme-key agreement role combination, KDF type,
					and, if supported, key confirmation role-key confirmation type combination, the
					tester shall generate 10 sets of test vectors. The data set consists of one set of domain
					parameter values (FFC) or the NIST approved curve (ECC) per 10 sets of public
					keys. These keys are static, ephemeral or both depending on the scheme being
					tested.<p></p>
					The evaluator shall obtain the DKM, the corresponding TOE’s public keys (static
					or ephemeral), the MAC tags, and any inputs used in the KDF, such as the Other
					Information field OI and TOE id fields.<p></p>
					If the TOE does not use a KDF defined in SP 800-56A, the evaluator shall obtain
					only the public keys and the hashed value of the shared secret. <p></p>
					The evaluator shall verify the correctness of the TSF’s implementation of a given
					scheme by using a known good implementation to calculate the shared secret value,
					derive the keying material DKM, and compare hashes or MAC tags generated from
					these values.<p></p>
					If key confirmation is supported, the TSF shall perform the above for each
					implemented approved MAC algorithm.<p></p>
					<i>Validity Test</i><p></p>
					The Validity test verifies the ability of the TOE to recognize another party’s valid
					and invalid key agreement results with or without key confirmation. To conduct this
					test, the evaluator shall obtain a list of the supporting cryptographic functions
					included in the SP800-56A key agreement implementation to determine which
					errors the TOE should be able to recognize. The evaluator generates a set of 24
					(FFC) or 30 (ECC) test vectors consisting of data sets including domain parameter
					values or NIST approved curves, the evaluator’s public keys, the TOE’s
					public/private key pairs, MACTag, and any inputs used in the KDF, such as the
					other info and TOE id fields.<p></p>
					The evaluator shall inject an error in some of the test vectors to test that the TOE
					recognizes invalid key agreement results caused by the following fields being
					incorrect: the shared secret value Z, the DKM, the other information field OI, the
					data to be MACed, or the generated MACTag. If the TOE contains the full or partial
					(only ECC) public key validation, The evaluator shall also individually inject errors
					in both parties’ static public keys, both parties’ ephemeral public keys and the
					TOE’s static private key to assure the TOE detects errors in the public key validation
					function or the partial key validation function (in ECC only). At least two of the test
					vectors shall remain unmodified and therefore should result in valid key agreement
					results (they should pass).<p></p>
					The TOE shall use these modified test vectors to emulate the key agreement scheme
					using the corresponding parameters. The evaluator shall compare the TOE’s results
					with the results using a known good implementation verifying that the TOE detects
					these errors.<p></p>

					To conduct this test the evaluator shall generate or obtain test vectors from a known
					good implementation of the TOE supported schemes. For each combination of
					supported key establishment scheme and its options (with or without key
					confirmation if supported, for each supported key confirmation MAC function if
					key confirmation is supported, and for each supported mask generation function if
					KTS-OAEP is supported), the tester shall generate 10 sets of test vectors. Each test
					vector shall include the RSA public key, the plaintext keying material, any
					additional input parameters if applicable, the MacKey and MacTag if key 
					confirmation is incorporated, and the outputted ciphertext. For each test vector, the
					evaluator shall perform a key establishment encryption operation on the TOE with
					the same inputs (in cases where key confirmation is incorporated, the test shall use
					the MacKey from the test vector instead of the randomly generated MacKey used
					in normal operation) and ensure that the outputted ciphertext is equivalent to the
					ciphertext in the test vector.<p></p>
					If the TOE acts as a receiver, the following evaluation activities shall be performed
					to ensure the proper operation of every TOE supported combination of RSA-based
					key establishment scheme:<p></p>
					To conduct this test the evaluator shall generate or obtain test vectors from a known
					good implementation of the TOE supported schemes. For each combination of
					supported key establishment scheme and its options (with our without key
					confirmation if supported, for each supported key confirmation MAC function if
					key confirmation is supported, and for each supported mask generation function if
					KTSOAEP is supported), the tester shall generate 10 sets of test vectors. Each test
					vector shall include the RSA private key, the plaintext keying material (KeyData),
					any additional input parameters if applicable, the MacTag in cases where key
					confirmation is incorporated, and the outputted ciphertext. For each test vector, the
					evaluator shall perform the key establishment decryption operation on the TOE and
					ensure that the outputted plaintext keying material (KeyData) is equivalent to the
					plain text keying material in the test vector. In cases where key confirmation is
					incorporated, the evaluator shall perform the key confirmation steps and ensure that
					the outputted MacTag is equivalent to the MacTag in the test vector.<p></p>
					The evaluator shall ensure that the TSS describes how the TOE handles decryption
					errors. In accordance with NIST Special Publication 800-56B, the TOE must not
					reveal the particular error that occurred, either through the contents of any outputted
					or logged error message or through timing variations. If KTS-OAEP is supported,
					the evaluator shall create separate contrived ciphertext values that trigger each of
					the three decryption error checks described in NIST Special Publication 800-56B
					section 7.2.2.3, ensure that each decryption attempt results in an error, and ensure
					that any outputted or logged error message is identical for each.<p></p>

					<b>Curve25519:</b><p></p>
					The evaluator shall verify a TOE's implementation of the key agreement scheme
					using the following Function and Validity tests. These validation tests for each key

					<b>Function Test</b><p></p>
					The Function test verifies the ability of the TOE to implement the key agreement
					schemes correctly. To conduct this test the evaluator shall generate or obtain test
					vectors from a known good implementation of the TOE supported schemes. For
					each supported key agreement role and hash function combination, the tester shall
					generate 10 sets of public keys. These keys are static, ephemeral or both depending
					on the scheme being tested.<p></p>
					The evaluator shall obtain the shared secret value K, and the hash of K. The
					evaluator shall verify the correctness of the TSF’s implementation of a given
					scheme by using a known good implementation to calculate the shared secret value
					K and compare the hash generated from this value.<p></p>
					<b>Validity Test</b><p></p>
					The Validity test verifies the ability of the TOE to recognize another party’s valid
					and invalid key agreement results. To conduct this test, the evaluator generates a set
					of 30 test vectors consisting of data sets including the evaluator’s public keys and
					the TOE’s public/private key pairs.<p></p>
					The evaluator shall inject an error in some of the test vectors to test that the TOE
					recognizes invalid key agreement results caused by the following fields being
					incorrect: the shared secret value K or the hash of K. At least two of the test vectors
					shall remain unmodified and therefore should result in valid key agreement results
					(they should pass).<p></p>

					requirement, the evaluators choose the specific activities that correspond to those
					selections.<p></p>
					The following tests require the developer to provide access to a test platform that
					provides the evaluator with tools that are not found on the TOE in its evaluated
					configuration.<p></p>
					<b><i>SigVer1: RSASSA-PKCS1-v1_5 and SigVer4: RSASSA-PSS</i></b><p></p>
					These tests are derived from The 186-4 RSA Validation System (RSA2VS),
					updated 8 Jul 2014, Section 6.4.<p></p>
					The FIPS 186-4 RSA Signature Verification Test tests the ability of the TSF to
					recognize valid and invalid signatures. The evaluator shall provide a modulus and
					three associated key pairs (d, e) for each combination of selected SHA algorithm,
					modulus size and hash size. Each private key d is used to sign six pseudorandom
					messages each of 1024 bits. For five of the six messages, the public key (e),
					message, IR format, padding, or signature is altered so that signature verification
					should fail. The test passes only if all the signatures made using unaltered
					parameters result in successful signature verification, and all the signatures made
					using altered parameters result in unsuccessful signature verification.<p></p>
					<b><i>SigVer5: ECDSA on NIST and Brainpool Curves</i></b><p></p>
					These tests are derived from The FIPS 186-4 Elliptic Curve Digital Signature
					Algorithm Validation System (ECDSA2VS), updated 18 Mar 2014, Section 6.5.<p></p>
					The FIPS 186-4 ECC Signature Verification Test tests the ability of the TSF to
					recognize valid and invalid signatures. The evaluator shall provide a modulus and
					associated key pair (x, y) for each combination of selected curve, SHA algorithm,
					modulus size, and hash size. Each private key (x) is used to sign 15 pseudorandom 
					messages of 1024 bits. For eight of the fifteen messages, the message, IR format,
					padding, or signature is altered so that signature verification should fail. The test
					passes only if all the signatures made using unaltered parameters result in successful
					signature verification, and all the signatures made using altered parameters result in
					unsuccessful signature verification.<p></p>
					<b><i>SigVer2: Digital Signature Scheme 2</i></b><p></p>
					The following or equivalent steps shall be taken to test the TSF.<p></p>
					For each supported modulus size, underlying hash algorithm, and length of the
					trailer field (1- or 2-byte), the evaluator shall generate NT sets of recoverable
					message (M1), non-recoverable message (M2), salt, public key and signature (<i>Σ</i>).<p></p>
					<ol type="1">
						<li><i>N<sub>T</sub></i> shall be greater than or equal to 20.</li>
						<li>The length of salts shall be selected from its supported length range of salt.
							The typical length of salt is equal to the output block length of underlying
							hash algorithm (see 9.2.2 of ISO/IEC 9796-2:2010).</li>
						<li>The length of recoverable messages should be selected by considering
							modulus size, output block length of underlying hash algorithm, and length
							of salt (<i>L<sub>S</sub></i>). As described in Annex D of ISO/IEC 9796-2:2010, it is desirable
							to maximise the length of recoverable message. The following table shows
							the maximum bit-length of recoverable message that is divisible by 512, for
							some combinations of modulus size, underlying hash algorithm, and length
							of salt.
							<table class="classic" style="width:50%">
								<tr class="header"><td>Maximum length of recoverable message divisible by 512 (bits)</td>

								<tr colspan="4">None that 2-byte trailer field is assumed in calculating the maximum length of recoverable message</tr>
							</table></li>
						<li>The length of non-recoverable messages should be selected by considering
							the underlying hash algorithm and usages. If the TSF is used for verifying
							the authenticity of software/firmware updates, the length of non-recoverable
							messages should be selected greater than or equal to 2048-bit. With this
							length range, it means that the underlying hash algorithm is also tested for
							two or more input blocks.</li>
						<li>The evaluator shall select approximately one half of <i>N<sub>T</sub></i> sets and shall alter
							one of the values (non-recoverable message, public key exponent or
							signature) in the sets. In altering public key exponent, the evaluator shall
							alter the public key exponent while keeping the exponent odd. In altering
							signatures, the following ways should be considered:
							<ol type="a">
								<li>Altering a signature just by replacing a bit in the bit-string representation
									of the signature</li>
								<li>Altering a signature so that the trailer in the message representative
									cannot be interpreted. This can be achieved by following ways:<ul>
									<li>Setting the rightmost four bits of the message representative to the
										values other than '1100'.</li>
									<li>In the case when 1-byte trailer is used, setting the rightmost byte of
										the message representative to the values other than '0xbc', while
										keeping the rightmost four bits to '1100'.</li>
									<li>In the case when 2-byte trailer is used, setting the rightmost byte of
										the message representative to the values other than '0xcc', while
										keeping the rightmost four bits to '1100'.</li></ul></li>
								<li>In the case when 2-byte trailer is used, altering a signature so that the
									hash algorithm identifier in the trailer (i.e. the left most byte of the
									trailer) does not correspond to hash algorithms identified in the SFR.
									The hash algorithm identifiers are 0x34 for SHA-256 (see Clause 10 of
									ISO/IEC 10118-3:2018), and 0x35 for SHA-512 (see Clause 11 of
									ISO/IEC 10118-3:2018).</li>
								<li>Let <i>L<sub>S</sub></i> be the length of salt, altering a signature so that the intermediate
									bit string <i>D</i> in the message representative is set to all zeroes except for
									the rightmost <i>L<sub>S</sub></i> bits of <i>D</i>.</li>
								<li> (non-conformant signature length) Altering a signature so that the length
									of signature <i>Σ</i> is changed to modulus size and the most significant bit of
									signature <i>Σ</i> is set equal to '1'.</li>
								<li>(non-conformant signature) Altering a signature so that the integer
									converted from signature <i>Σ</i> is greater than modulus <i>n</i>.</li>
							</ol>
						</li>
					</ol>
					The evaluator shall supply the NT sets to the TSF and obtain in response a set of
					NT Verification-Success or Verification-Fail values. When the VerificationSuccess is 
					obtained, the evaluator shall also obtain recovered message (M 1*).<p></p>
					The evaluator shall verify that Verification-Success results correspond to the
					unaltered sets and Verification-Fail results correspond to the altered sets.<p></p>
					For each recovered message, the evaluator shall compare the recovered message
					(M1*) with the corresponding recoverable message (M 1) in the unaltered sets.<p></p>
					The test passes only if all the signatures made using unaltered sets result in
					Verification-Success, each recovered message (M 1*) is equal to corresponding M 
					1 in the unaltered sets, and all the signatures made using altered sets result in
					Verification-Fail.<p></p>
					<b><i>SigVer3: Digital Signature Scheme 3</i></b><p></p>
					The evaluator shall perform the test described in SigVer2: Digital Signature Scheme
					2 while using a fixed salt for NT sets.<p></p>
				</div><div class="comp" id=""><h4>FCS_COP.1/SKC Cryptographic Operation (Symmetric Key Cryptography)</h4>
				
				
				
				
			<div class="eacategory">TSS</div>
					The evaluator shall check that the TSS includes a description of encryption
					functions used for symmetric key encryption. The evaluator should check that this
					description of the selected encryption function includes the key sizes and modes of
					operations as specified in the cPP table 9 “Supported Methods for Symmetric Key
					Cryptography Operation.”<p></p>
					The evaluator shall check that the TSS describes the means by which the TOE
					satisfies constraints on algorithm parameters included in the selections made for
					‘cryptographic algorithm’ and ‘list of standards’.<p></p> 
				<div class="eacategory">Guidance</div>
					If the product supports multiple modes, the evaluator shall examine the vendor’s
					documentation to determine that the method of choosing a specific mode/key size
					by the end user is described.
				<div class="eacategory">KMD</div>
					The evaluator shall examine the KMD to ensure that the points at which symmetric
					key encryption and decryption occurs are described, and that the complete data path
					for symmetric key encryption is described. The evaluator checks that this
					description is consistent with the relevant parts of the TSS.<p></p>
					Assessment of the complete data path for symmetric key encryption includes
					confirming that the KMD describes the data flow from the device’s host interface
					to the device’s non-volatile memory storing the data, and gives information
					enabling the user data datapath to be distinguished from those situations in which
					data bypasses the data encryption engine (e.g. read-write operations to an
					unencrypted Master Boot Record area). The evaluator shall ensure that the
					documentation of the data path is detailed enough that it thoroughly describes the
					parts of the TOE that the data passes through (e.g. different memory types,
					processors and co-processors), its encryption state (i.e. encrypted or unencrypted)
					in each part, and any places where the data is stored. For example, any caching or
					buffering of the data should be identified and distinguished from the final
					destination in non-volatile memory (the latter represents the location from which
					the host will expect to retrieve the data in future).<p></p>
					If support for AES-CTR is claimed and the counter value source is internal to the
					TOE, the evaluator shall verify that the KMD describes the internal counter
					mechanism used to ensure that it provides unique counter block values.<p></p>
				<div class="eacategory">Tests</div>
					The following tests require the developer to provide access to a test platform that
					provides the evaluator with tools that are typically not found on factory products.<p></p>
					The following tests are conditional based upon the selections made in the SFR. The
					evaluator shall perform the following test or witness respective tests executed by
					the developer. The tests must be executed on a platform that is as close as practically
					possible to the operational platform (but which may be instrumented in terms of,
					for example, use of a debug mode). Where the test is not carried out on the TOE
					itself, the test platform shall be identified and the differences between test
					environment and TOE execution environment shall be described.<p></p>
					Preconditions for testing:<ul>
					<li>Specification of keys as input parameter to the function to be tested</li>
					<li>specification of required input parameters such as modes</li>
					<li>Specification of user data (plaintext)</li>
					<li>Tapping of encrypted user data (ciphertext) directly in the non-volatile memory</li></ul>

					known-good implementation.<p></p>

			any arbitrary subject-object-operation pairing, which of the following is true:<ol type="a">
			<li>The subject can always perform the desired operation.</li>
			<li>The subject can never perform the desired operation, either because they
				lack sufficient permission or because the TSF includes no interface to
				support the operation.</li>
			<li>The subject can only perform the desired operation under certain
				conditions (which the evaluator shall verify are described in the TSS). For
				example, “the S.CA subject may only perform the OP.Destroy operation
				on an OB.SDO object if it was the subject that originally created or
				imported the SDO.”</li>
			<li>The subject can only perform the desired operation on one or more
				attributes of the object as opposed to the entire object itself (which the

			<li>Whether the subject can perform the desired operation depends on TSF
				configuration (which the evaluator shall verify is described in the TSS as
				part of the evaluation of FMT_SMF.1).</li>
			<li>Some combination of c, d, and e.</li></ol>
				Given that this SFR requires a large number of potential subject-object-operation

				finds suitable.<p></p>
			Note that the DSC developer may not use the same terminology for its subjects,
			objects, and operations as the PP. If this is the case, the evaluator shall verify that

			require the use of an automated script. If a test script is made available, the evaluator
			shall verify that it includes sufficient detail to validate the claims made in the TSS.<p></p>
			For each subject/object/operation/attribute combination, the evaluator shall attempt
			to perform the operation or determine that no interface is present to attempt the
			operation, consistent with the limitations described in the TSS.<p></p>

			For each case where the operation succeeds or fails based on one or more specific
			conditions, the evaluator shall ensure that both positive and negative testing is
			performed such that the presence of the conditions causes the test to succeed while
			the absence of the conditions causes the test to fail.<p></p>

              verify that each mechanism for deployment of security updates is described. <br/> The
              evaluator will verify that, for each deployment mechanism described for the update
              process, the TSS lists a time between public disclosure of a vulnerability and public
              availability of the security update to the OS patching this vulnerability, to include
              any third-party or carrier delays in deployment. The evaluator will verify that this
              time is expressed in a number or range of days. <br/> The evaluator will verify that
              this description includes the publicly available mechanisms (including either an email
              address or website) for reporting security issues related to the OS. The evaluator
              shall verify that the description of this mechanism includes a method for protecting
              the report either using a public key for encrypting email or a trusted channel for a
              website. </div><h2 class="indexable" data-level="1" id="ate">3.4 Class ATE: Tests</h2><div class="comp" id=""><h4>ATE_IND.1 Independent Testing – Conformance (ATE_IND.1)</h4>The evaluator will prepare a test plan and report documenting the testing
              aspects of the system, including any application crashes during testing. The evaluator
              shall determine the root cause of any application crashes and include that information
              in the report. The test plan covers all of the testing actions contained in the 
              <a href="#bibCEM">[CEM]</a> and the body of this PP’s Assurance Activities. <br/> While it is
              not necessary to have one test case per test listed in an Assurance Activity, the
              evaluator must document in the test plan that each applicable testing requirement in
              the ST is covered. The test plan identifies the platforms to be
              tested, and for those platforms not included in the test plan but included in the
                ST, the test plan provides a justification for not testing the
              platforms. This justification must address the differences between the tested
              platforms and the untested platforms, and make an argument that the differences do not
              affect the testing to be performed. It is not sufficient to merely assert that the
              differences have no affect; rationale must be provided. If all platforms claimed in
              the ST are tested, then no rationale is necessary. The test plan
              describes the composition of each platform to be tested, and any setup that is
              necessary beyond what is contained in the AGD documentation. It should be noted that
              the evaluator is expected to follow the AGD documentation for installation and setup
              of each platform either as part of a test or as a standard pre-test condition. This
              may include special test drivers or tools. For each driver or tool, an argument (not
              just an assertion) should be provided that the driver or tool will not adversely
              affect the performance of the functionality by the OS and its
              platform. <br/> This also includes the configuration of the cryptographic engine to be
              used. The cryptographic algorithms implemented by this engine are those specified by
              this PP and used by the cryptographic protocols being evaluated (IPsec, TLS). The test
              plan identifies high-level test objectives as well as the test procedures to be
              followed to achieve those objectives. These procedures include expected results. <br/>
              The test report (which could just be an annotated version of the test plan) details
              the activities that took place when the test procedures were executed, and includes
              the actual results of the tests. This shall be a cumulative account, so if there was a
              test run that resulted in a failure; a fix installed; and then a successful re-run of
              the test, the report would show a “fail” and “pass” result (and the supporting
              details), and not just the “pass” result.</div><h2 class="indexable" data-level="1" id="ava">3.5 Class AVA: Vulnerability Assessment</h2><div class="comp" id=""><h4>AVA_VAN.1 Vulnerability Survey (AVA_VAN.1)</h4>The evaluator will generate a report to document their
              findings with respect to this requirement. This report could physically be part of the
              overall test report mentioned in ATE_IND, or a separate document. The evaluator
              performs a search of public information to find vulnerabilities that have been found
              in similar applications with a particular focus on network protocols the application
              uses and document formats it parses. 
              The evaluator documents the sources consulted and
              the vulnerabilities found in the report. 
              <br/>
              For each vulnerability found, the evaluator
              either provides a rationale with respect to its non-applicability, or the evaluator
              formulates a test (using the guidelines provided in ATE_IND) to confirm the
              vulnerability, if suitable. Suitability is determined by assessing the attack vector
              needed to take advantage of the vulnerability. If exploiting the vulnerability
              requires expert skills and an electron microscope, for instance, then a test would not
              be suitable and an appropriate justification would be formulated.</div><h1 id="sup-info" class="indexable" data-level="0">4 Required Supplementary Information</h1><p>This Supporting Document has no required supplementary information beyond the ST, operational
