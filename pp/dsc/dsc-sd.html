    to describe the security functionality of 
      Dedicated Security Components products in terms of 
    [CC] and to define functional and assurance requirements for them.

    </p><p> 
Although Evaluation Activities are defined mainly for the evaluators to follow, in general they also help developers to prepare for evaluation by identifying specific requirements for their TOE.
    The specific requirements in Evaluation Activities may in some cases clarify the meaning of Security
    Functional Requirements (SFR), and may identify particular requirements for the content of Security
    Targets (ST) (especially the TOE Summary Specification), user guidance documentation, and possibly
    supplementary information (e.g. for entropy analysis or cryptographic key management architecture).</p><h2 id="structure" class="indexable" data-level="1">1.2 Structure of the Document</h2><p>Evaluation Activities can be defined for both SFRs and Security Assurance Requirements (SAR),
    which are themselves defined in separate sections of the SD.</p><p>If any Evaluation Activity cannot be successfully completed in an evaluation, then
    the overall verdict for the evaluation is a 'fail'.
    In rare cases there may be acceptable reasons why an Evaluation Activity
    may be modified or deemed not applicable for a particular TOE, 
    but this must be approved by the Certification Body for the evaluation.</p><p>In general, if all Evaluation Activities (for both SFRs and SARs) are successfully
    completed in an evaluation then it would be expected that the overall verdict for 
    the evaluation is a ‘pass’.
    To reach a ‘fail’ verdict when the Evaluation Activities have been successfully 
    completed would require a specific justification from the evaluator as to why the 
    Evaluation Activities were not sufficient for that TOE.
    </p><p>Similarly, at the more granular level of assurance components, if the Evaluation 
    Activities for an assurance component and all of its related SFR Evaluation 
    Activities are successfully completed in an evaluation then it would be expected 
    that the verdict for the assurance component is a ‘pass’.
    To reach a ‘fail’ verdict for the assurance component when these Evaluation 
    Activities have been successfully completed would require a specific justification 
    from the evaluator as to why the Evaluation Activities were not sufficient for that TOE.

    well as any required supplementary material that may be treated as proprietary),

    For findings regarding the TSS section, the evaluator’s verdicts will be 
    associated with the CEM work unit ASE_TSS.1-1.
    Evaluator verdicts associated with the supplementary evidence will also be 
    associated with ASE_TSS.1-1, 
    since the requirement to provide such evidence is specified in ASE in the PP.</p><p>For ensuring the guidance documentation provides sufficient information for 
    the administrators/users as it pertains to SFRs, the evaluator’s verdicts will 
    be associated with CEM work units ADV_FSP.1-7, AGD_OPE.1-4, and AGD_OPE.1-5.</p><p>Finally, the subsection labelled Tests is where the authors have determined 
    that testing of the product in the context of the associated SFR is necessary.
    While the evaluator is expected to develop tests, there may be instances where 
    it is more practical for the developer to construct tests, or where the 
    developer may have existing tests. 
    Therefore, it is acceptable for the evaluator to witness developer-generated 
    tests in lieu of executing the tests. 
    In this case, the evaluator must ensure the developer’s tests are executing both 
    in the manner declared by the developer and as mandated by the EA. 
    The CEM work units that are associated with the EAs specified in this section 
    are: ATE_IND.1-3, ATE_IND.1-4, ATE_IND.1-5, ATE_IND.1-6, and ATE_IND.1-7.</p><h2 class="indexable" data-level="1" id="man-sfrs">2.1 TOE SFR Evaluation Activities</h2><h3 class="indexable" data-level="2" id="fcs">2.1.1 Cryptographic Support (FCS)</h3><div class="comp" id=""><h4>FCS_CKM.1 Cryptographic Key Generation</h4>

		<div class="eacategory">TSS</div>
					The evaluator shall examine the TSS to ensure it lists all relevant keys and keying
					material (describing the source of the data, all memory types in which the data is
					stored (covering storage both during and outside of a session, and both plaintext and
					non-plaintext forms of the data)), all relevant destruction situations (including the
					point in time at which the destruction occurs; e.g. factory reset or device wipe
					function, change of authorization data, change of DEK, completion of use of an
					intermediate key) and the destruction method used in each case. The evaluator shall
					confirm that the description of the data and storage locations is consistent with the
					functions carried out by the TOE (e.g. that all keys in the key chain are accounted
					for). (Where keys are stored encrypted or wrapped under another key then this may need to
					be explained in order to allow the evaluator to confirm the consistency of the description 
					of keys with the TOE functions). <p></p>
					The evaluator shall check that the TSS identifies any configurations or
					circumstances that may not conform to the key destruction requirement (see further
					discussion in the AGD section below). Note that reference may be made to the AGD
					for description of the detail of such cases where destruction may be prevented or
					delayed.<p></p>
					Where the ST specifies the use of “a value that does not contain any sensitive data”
					to overwrite keys, the evaluator shall examine the TSS to ensure that it describes
					how that pattern is obtained and used, and that this justifies the claim that the pattern
					does not contain any sensitive data. <p></p>
				<div class="eacategory">Guidance</div>
					The evaluator shall check that the guidance documentation for the TOE requires
					users to ensure that the TOE remains under the user’s control while a session is
					active.<p></p>
					A TOE may be subject to situations that could prevent or delay data destruction in
					some cases. The evaluator shall check that the guidance documentation identifies
					configurations or circumstances that may not strictly conform to the key destruction
					requirement, and that this description is consistent with the relevant parts of the TSS
					(and KMD). The evaluator shall check that the guidance documentation provides
					guidance on situations where key destruction may be delayed at the physical layer,
					identifying any additional mitigation actions for the user (e.g. there might be some
					operation the user can invoke, or the user might be advised to retain control of the
					device for some particular time to maximise the probability that garbage collection
					will have occurred).<p></p>
					For example, when the TOE does not have full access to the physical memory, it is
					possible that the storage may implement wear-levelling and garbage collection. This
					may result in additional copies of the data that are logically inaccessible but persist
					physically. Where available, the TOE might then describe use of the TRIM
					command	and garbage collection to destroy these persistent copies upon their
					deletion (this would be explained in TSS and guidance documentation). <p></p>
					Where TRIM is used then the TSS or guidance documentation is also expected to describe how
					the keys are stored such that they are not inaccessible to TRIM, (e.g. they would need not
					to be contained in a file less than 982 bytes which would be completely contained in the
					master file table.<p></p>
				<div class="eacategory">KMD</div>
						The evaluator shall examine the KMD to verify that it identifies and describes the
						interfaces that are used to service commands to read/write memory. The evaluator
						shall examine the interface description for each different media type to ensure that
						the interface supports the selections made by the ST author.<p></p>
						45 The evaluator shall examine the KMD to ensure that all keys and keying material
						identified in the TSS and KMD have been accounted for.<p></p>
						46 Note that where selections include ‘destruction of reference to the key directly
						followed by a request for garbage collection’ (for volatile memory) then the
						evaluator shall examine the KMD to ensure that it explains the nature of the
						destruction of the reference, the request for garbage collection, and of the garbage
						collection process itself.<p></p>
				<div class="eacategory">Tests</div>
					The following tests require the developer to provide access to a test platform that
					provides the evaluator with tools that are typically not found on factory products.<p></p>
					The evaluator shall perform the following tests:
					<ul>
						<li><b>Test 1: </b>
							Applied to each key or keying material held as plaintext in volatile
							memory and subject to destruction by overwrite by the TOE (whether or not the
							plaintext value is subsequently encrypted for storage in volatile or non-volatile
							memory).<p></p>
							The evaluator shall:<ol type="1">
							<li>Record the value of the key or keying material.</li>
							<li>Cause the TOE to dump the SDO/SDE memory of the TOE into a binary file.</li>
							<li>Search the content of the binary file created in Step #2 to locate all
								instances of the known key value from Step #1.<p></p>
								Note that the primary purpose of Step #3 is to demonstrate that appropriate
								search commands are being used for Steps #8 and #9.</li>
							<li>Cause the TOE to perform normal cryptographic processing with the key
								from Step #1.</li>
							<li>Cause the TOE to destroy the key.</li>
							<li>Cause the TOE to stop execution but not exit.</li>
							<li>Cause the TOE to dump the SDO/SDE memory of the TOE into a binary
								file.</li>
							<li>Search the content of the binary file created in Step #7 for instances of the
								known key value from Step #1.</li>
							<li>Break the key value from Step #1 into an evaluator-chosen set of
								fragments and perform a search using each fragment. (Note that the
								evaluator shall first confirm with the developer how the key is normally
								stored, in order to choose fragment sizes that are the same or smaller than
								any fragmentation of the data that may be implemented by the TOE. The
								endianness or byte-order should also be taken into account in the search.)</li>
							</ol><p></p>
							Steps #1-8 ensure that the complete key does not exist anywhere in volatile
							memory. If a copy is found, then the test fails.<p></p>
							Step #9 ensures that partial key fragments do not remain in memory. If the
							evaluator finds a 32-or-greater-consecutive-bit fragment, then fail immediately.
							Otherwise, there is a chance that it is not within the context of a key (e.g., some
							random bits that happen to match). If this is the case the test should be repeated
							with a different key in Step #1. If a fragment is also found in this repeated run
							then the test fails unless the developer provides a reasonable explanation for the
							collision, then the evaluator may give a pass on this test.<p></p>
						</li>
						<li><b>Test 2: </b>
							Applied to each key and keying material held in non-volatile memory and
							subject to destruction by overwrite by the TOE.<ol type="1">
							<li>Record the value of the key or keying material.</li>
							<li>Cause the TOE to perform normal cryptographic processing with the key
								from Step #1.</li>
							<li>Search the non-volatile memory the key was stored in for instances of the
								known key value from Step #1. <p></p>
								Note that the primary purpose of Step #3 is to demonstrate that appropriate

							<li>Cause the TOE to clear the key.</li>
							<li>Search the non-volatile memory in which the key was stored for instances
								of the known key value from Step #1. If a copy is found, then the test fails.</li>
							<li>Break the key value from Step #1 into an evaluator-chosen set of
								fragments and perform a search using each fragment. (Note that the
								evaluator shall first confirm with the developer how the key is normally
								stored, in order to choose fragment sizes that are the same or smaller than
								any fragmentation of the data that may be implemented by the TOE. The
								endianness or byte-order should also be taken into account in the search).</li>
							</ol>
							Step #6 ensures that partial key fragments do not remain in non-volatile memory.
							If the evaluator finds a 32-or-greater-consecutive-bit fragment, then fail
							immediately. Otherwise, there is a chance that it is not within the context of a key
							(e.g., some random bits that happen to match). If this is the case the test should be
							repeated with a different key in Step #1. If a fragment is also found in this
							repeated run then the test fails unless the developer provides a reasonable
							explanation for the collision, then the evaluator may give a pass on this test.
						</li>
						<li><b>Test 3: </b>
							Applied to each key and keying material held in non-volatile memory and
							subject to destruction by overwrite by the TOE.<ol type="1">
							<li>Record memory of the key or keying material.</li>
							<li>Cause the TOE to perform normal cryptographic processing with the key
								from Step #1.</li>
							<li>Cause the TOE to clear the key. Record the value to be used for the
								overwrite of the key. </li>
							<li>Examine the memory from Step #1 to ensure the appropriate pattern
								(recorded in Step #3) is used. </li>
							</ol>
							The test succeeds if correct pattern is found in the memory location. If the pattern
							is not found, then the test fails.

						The tests below are derived from the “The Secure Hash Algorithm Validation
						System (SHAVS), Updated: May 21, 2014” from the National Institute of Standards
						and Technology.<p></p>
						The TSF hashing functions can be implemented with one of two orientations. The
						first is a byte-oriented implementation: this hashes messages that are an integral
						number of bytes in length (i.e., the length (in bits) of the message to be hashed is
						divisible by 8). The second is a bit-oriented implementation: this hashes messages
						of arbitrary length. Separate tests for each orientation are given below.<p></p>
						The evaluator shall perform all of the following tests for each hash algorithm and

						<b>Short Messages Test, Bit-oriented Implementation</b><p></p>
						The evaluators devise an input set consisting of m+1 messages, where m is the block

						<b>Selected Long Messages Test, Bit-oriented Implementation</b><p></p>
						The evaluators devise an input set consisting of m messages, where m is the block

						<b>Selected Long Messages Test, Byte-oriented Implementation</b><p></p>
						The evaluators devise an input set consisting of m/8 messages, where m is the block
						length of the hash algorithm in bits (see SHA Properties Table). The length of the
						ith message is m + 8*99*i, where 1 ≤ i ≤ m/8. The message text shall be pseudorandomly generated. The evaluators compute the message digest for each of the
						messages and ensure that the correct result is produced when the messages are
						provided to the TSF.<p></p>
						<b>Pseudo-randomly Generated Messages Test</b><p></p>
						The evaluators randomly generate a seed that is n bits long, where n is the length of
						the message digest produced by the hash function to be tested. The evaluators then

						For each SHA-3-XXX implementation, XXX represents d, the digest length in bits.
						The capacity, c, is equal to 2d bits. The rate is equal to 1600-c bits.<p></p>
						65 The TSF hashing functions can be implemented with one of two orientations. The
						first is a bit-oriented mode that hashes messages of arbitrary length. The second is
						a byte-oriented mode that hashes messages that are an integral number of bytes in

						The evaluators devise an input set consisting of rate+1 short messages. The length
						of the messages ranges sequentially from 0 to rate bits. The message text shall be
						pseudo-randomly generated. The evaluators compute the message digest for each
						of the messages and ensure that the correct result is produced when the messages

						<b>Short Messages Test, Byte-oriented Mode</b><p></p>
						The evaluators devise an input set consisting of rate/8+1 short messages. The length

						<b>Selected Long Messages Test, Bit-oriented Mode</b><p></p>
						The evaluators devise an input set consisting of 100 long messages ranging in size
						from rate+(rate+1) to rate+(100*(rate+1)), incrementing by rate+1. (For example,
						SHA-3-256 has a rate of 1088 bits. Therefore, 100 messages will be generated with
						lengths 2177, 3266, …, 109988 bits.) The message text shall be pseudo-randomly

						The evaluators devise an input set consisting of 100 messages ranging in size from
						(rate+(rate+8)) to (rate+100*(rate+8)), incrementing by rate+8. (For example,
						SHA-3-256 has a rate of 1088 bits. Therefore 100 messages will be generated of

					The evaluator shall verify the implementation of the key generation routines of the

					<b>If ECDH-NIST or ECDH-BPC is claimed:</b><p></p>
					<b>SP800-56A Key Agreement Schemes</b><p></p>
					The evaluator shall verify a TOE's implementation of SP800-56A key agreement
					schemes using the following Function and Validity tests. These validation tests for
					each key agreement scheme verify that a TOE has implemented the components of
					the key agreement scheme according to the specifications in the Recommendation.
					These components include the calculation of the DLC primitives (the shared secret
					value Z) and the calculation of the derived keying material (DKM) via the Key
					Derivation Function (KDF). If key confirmation is supported, the evaluator shall
					also verify that the components of key confirmation have been implemented
					correctly, using the test procedures described below. This includes the parsing of
					the DKM, the generation of MACdata and the calculation of MACtag.<p></p>
					<i>Function Test</i><p></p>
					The Function test verifies the ability of the TOE to implement the key agreement
					schemes correctly. To conduct this test the evaluator shall generate or obtain test
					vectors from a known good implementation of the TOE supported schemes. For
					each supported key agreement scheme-key agreement role combination, KDF type,
					and, if supported, key confirmation role-key confirmation type combination, the
					tester shall generate 10 sets of test vectors. The data set consists of one set of domain
					parameter values (FFC) or the NIST approved curve (ECC) per 10 sets of public
					keys. These keys are static, ephemeral or both depending on the scheme being
					tested.<p></p>
					The evaluator shall obtain the DKM, the corresponding TOE’s public keys (static
					or ephemeral), the MAC tags, and any inputs used in the KDF, such as the Other
					Information field OI and TOE id fields.<p></p>
					If the TOE does not use a KDF defined in SP 800-56A, the evaluator shall obtain
					only the public keys and the hashed value of the shared secret. <p></p>
					The evaluator shall verify the correctness of the TSF’s implementation of a given
					scheme by using a known good implementation to calculate the shared secret value,
					derive the keying material DKM, and compare hashes or MAC tags generated from
					these values.<p></p>
					If key confirmation is supported, the TSF shall perform the above for each
					implemented approved MAC algorithm.<p></p>
					<i>Validity Test</i><p></p>
					The Validity test verifies the ability of the TOE to recognize another party’s valid
					and invalid key agreement results with or without key confirmation. To conduct this
					test, the evaluator shall obtain a list of the supporting cryptographic functions
					included in the SP800-56A key agreement implementation to determine which
					errors the TOE should be able to recognize. The evaluator generates a set of 24
					(FFC) or 30 (ECC) test vectors consisting of data sets including domain parameter
					values or NIST approved curves, the evaluator’s public keys, the TOE’s
					public/private key pairs, MACTag, and any inputs used in the KDF, such as the
					other info and TOE id fields.<p></p>
					The evaluator shall inject an error in some of the test vectors to test that the TOE
					recognizes invalid key agreement results caused by the following fields being
					incorrect: the shared secret value Z, the DKM, the other information field OI, the
					data to be MACed, or the generated MACTag. If the TOE contains the full or partial
					(only ECC) public key validation, The evaluator shall also individually inject errors
					in both parties’ static public keys, both parties’ ephemeral public keys and the
					TOE’s static private key to assure the TOE detects errors in the public key validation
					function or the partial key validation function (in ECC only). At least two of the test
					vectors shall remain unmodified and therefore should result in valid key agreement
					results (they should pass).<p></p>
					The TOE shall use these modified test vectors to emulate the key agreement scheme
					using the corresponding parameters. The evaluator shall compare the TOE’s results
					with the results using a known good implementation verifying that the TOE detects
					these errors.<p></p>
					<b>If KAS1, KAS2, KTS-OAEP, or RSAES-PKCS1-v1_5 is claimed:</b><p></p>
					<b>SP800-56B and PKCS#1 Key Establishment Schemes</b><p></p>
					If the TOE acts as a sender, the following evaluation activity shall be performed to
					ensure the proper operation of every TOE supported combination of RSA-based
					key establishment scheme:<p></p>
					To conduct this test the evaluator shall generate or obtain test vectors from a known
					good implementation of the TOE supported schemes. For each combination of
					supported key establishment scheme and its options (with or without key
					confirmation if supported, for each supported key confirmation MAC function if
					key confirmation is supported, and for each supported mask generation function if
					KTS-OAEP is supported), the tester shall generate 10 sets of test vectors. Each test
					vector shall include the RSA public key, the plaintext keying material, any
					additional input parameters if applicable, the MacKey and MacTag if key

					the same inputs (in cases where key confirmation is incorporated, the test shall use
					the MacKey from the test vector instead of the randomly generated MacKey used
					in normal operation) and ensure that the outputted ciphertext is equivalent to the
					ciphertext in the test vector.<p></p>
					If the TOE acts as a receiver, the following evaluation activities shall be performed
					to ensure the proper operation of every TOE supported combination of RSA-based
					key establishment scheme:<p></p>
					To conduct this test the evaluator shall generate or obtain test vectors from a known
					good implementation of the TOE supported schemes. For each combination of
					supported key establishment scheme and its options (with our without key
					confirmation if supported, for each supported key confirmation MAC function if
					key confirmation is supported, and for each supported mask generation function if
					KTSOAEP is supported), the tester shall generate 10 sets of test vectors. Each test
					vector shall include the RSA private key, the plaintext keying material (KeyData),
					any additional input parameters if applicable, the MacTag in cases where key
					confirmation is incorporated, and the outputted ciphertext. For each test vector, the
					evaluator shall perform the key establishment decryption operation on the TOE and
					ensure that the outputted plaintext keying material (KeyData) is equivalent to the
					plain text keying material in the test vector. In cases where key confirmation is
					incorporated, the evaluator shall perform the key confirmation steps and ensure that
					the outputted MacTag is equivalent to the MacTag in the test vector.<p></p>
					The evaluator shall ensure that the TSS describes how the TOE handles decryption
					errors. In accordance with NIST Special Publication 800-56B, the TOE must not
					reveal the particular error that occurred, either through the contents of any outputted
					or logged error message or through timing variations. If KTS-OAEP is supported,
					the evaluator shall create separate contrived ciphertext values that trigger each of
					the three decryption error checks described in NIST Special Publication 800-56B
					section 7.2.2.3, ensure that each decryption attempt results in an error, and ensure

					agreement scheme according to the specification. These components include the
					calculation of the shared secret K and the hash of K.<p></p>
					<b>Function Test</b><p></p>
					The Function test verifies the ability of the TOE to implement the key agreement
					schemes correctly. To conduct this test the evaluator shall generate or obtain test
					vectors from a known good implementation of the TOE supported schemes. For
					each supported key agreement role and hash function combination, the tester shall
					generate 10 sets of public keys. These keys are static, ephemeral or both depending
					on the scheme being tested.<p></p>
					The evaluator shall obtain the shared secret value K, and the hash of K. The
					evaluator shall verify the correctness of the TSF’s implementation of a given
					scheme by using a known good implementation to calculate the shared secret value
					K and compare the hash generated from this value.<p></p>
					<b>Validity Test</b><p></p>
					The Validity test verifies the ability of the TOE to recognize another party’s valid
					and invalid key agreement results. To conduct this test, the evaluator generates a set
					of 30 test vectors consisting of data sets including the evaluator’s public keys and
					the TOE’s public/private key pairs.<p></p>
					The evaluator shall inject an error in some of the test vectors to test that the TOE
					recognizes invalid key agreement results caused by the following fields being
					incorrect: the shared secret value K or the hash of K. At least two of the test vectors
					shall remain unmodified and therefore should result in valid key agreement results
					(they should pass).<p></p>
					The TOE shall use these modified test vectors to emulate the key agreement scheme
					using the corresponding parameters. The evaluator shall compare the TOE’s results
					with the results using a known good implementation verifying that the TOE detects
					these errors.<p></p>

		<div class="eacategory">TSS</div>
					The evaluator shall examine the TSS to ensure it lists all relevant keys and keying
					material (describing the source of the data, all memory types in which the data is
					stored (covering storage both during and outside of a session, and both plaintext and
					non-plaintext forms of the data)), all relevant destruction situations (including the
					point in time at which the destruction occurs; e.g. factory reset or device wipe
					function, change of authorization data, change of DEK, completion of use of an
					intermediate key) and the destruction method used in each case. The evaluator shall
					confirm that the description of the data and storage locations is consistent with the
					functions carried out by the TOE (e.g. that all keys in the key chain are accounted
					for). (Where keys are stored encrypted or wrapped under another key then this may need to
					be explained in order to allow the evaluator to confirm the consistency of the description 
					of keys with the TOE functions). <p></p>
					The evaluator shall check that the TSS identifies any configurations or
					circumstances that may not conform to the key destruction requirement (see further
					discussion in the AGD section below). Note that reference may be made to the AGD
					for description of the detail of such cases where destruction may be prevented or
					delayed.<p></p>
					Where the ST specifies the use of “a value that does not contain any sensitive data”
					to overwrite keys, the evaluator shall examine the TSS to ensure that it describes
					how that pattern is obtained and used, and that this justifies the claim that the pattern
					does not contain any sensitive data. <p></p>
				<div class="eacategory">Guidance</div>
					The evaluator shall check that the guidance documentation for the TOE requires
					users to ensure that the TOE remains under the user’s control while a session is
					active.<p></p>
					A TOE may be subject to situations that could prevent or delay data destruction in
					some cases. The evaluator shall check that the guidance documentation identifies
					configurations or circumstances that may not strictly conform to the key destruction
					requirement, and that this description is consistent with the relevant parts of the TSS
					(and KMD). The evaluator shall check that the guidance documentation provides
					guidance on situations where key destruction may be delayed at the physical layer,
					identifying any additional mitigation actions for the user (e.g. there might be some
					operation the user can invoke, or the user might be advised to retain control of the
					device for some particular time to maximise the probability that garbage collection
					will have occurred).<p></p>
					For example, when the TOE does not have full access to the physical memory, it is
					possible that the storage may implement wear-levelling and garbage collection. This
					may result in additional copies of the data that are logically inaccessible but persist
					physically. Where available, the TOE might then describe use of the TRIM
					command	and garbage collection to destroy these persistent copies upon their
					deletion (this would be explained in TSS and guidance documentation). <p></p>
					Where TRIM is used then the TSS or guidance documentation is also expected to describe how
					the keys are stored such that they are not inaccessible to TRIM, (e.g. they would need not
					to be contained in a file less than 982 bytes which would be completely contained in the
					master file table.<p></p>
				<div class="eacategory">KMD</div>
						The evaluator shall examine the KMD to verify that it identifies and describes the
						interfaces that are used to service commands to read/write memory. The evaluator
						shall examine the interface description for each different media type to ensure that
						the interface supports the selections made by the ST author.<p></p>
						45 The evaluator shall examine the KMD to ensure that all keys and keying material
						identified in the TSS and KMD have been accounted for.<p></p>
						46 Note that where selections include ‘destruction of reference to the key directly
						followed by a request for garbage collection’ (for volatile memory) then the
						evaluator shall examine the KMD to ensure that it explains the nature of the
						destruction of the reference, the request for garbage collection, and of the garbage
						collection process itself.<p></p>
				<div class="eacategory">Tests</div>
					The following tests require the developer to provide access to a test platform that
					provides the evaluator with tools that are typically not found on factory products.<p></p>
					The evaluator shall perform the following tests:
					<ul>
						<li><b>Test 1: </b>
							Applied to each key or keying material held as plaintext in volatile
							memory and subject to destruction by overwrite by the TOE (whether or not the
							plaintext value is subsequently encrypted for storage in volatile or non-volatile
							memory).<p></p>
							The evaluator shall:<ol type="1">
							<li>Record the value of the key or keying material.</li>
							<li>Cause the TOE to dump the SDO/SDE memory of the TOE into a binary file.</li>
							<li>Search the content of the binary file created in Step #2 to locate all
								instances of the known key value from Step #1.<p></p>
								Note that the primary purpose of Step #3 is to demonstrate that appropriate
								search commands are being used for Steps #8 and #9.</li>
							<li>Cause the TOE to perform normal cryptographic processing with the key
								from Step #1.</li>
							<li>Cause the TOE to destroy the key.</li>
							<li>Cause the TOE to stop execution but not exit.</li>
							<li>Cause the TOE to dump the SDO/SDE memory of the TOE into a binary
								file.</li>
							<li>Search the content of the binary file created in Step #7 for instances of the
								known key value from Step #1.</li>
							<li>Break the key value from Step #1 into an evaluator-chosen set of
								fragments and perform a search using each fragment. (Note that the
								evaluator shall first confirm with the developer how the key is normally
								stored, in order to choose fragment sizes that are the same or smaller than
								any fragmentation of the data that may be implemented by the TOE. The
								endianness or byte-order should also be taken into account in the search.)</li>
							</ol><p></p>
							Steps #1-8 ensure that the complete key does not exist anywhere in volatile
							memory. If a copy is found, then the test fails.<p></p>
							Step #9 ensures that partial key fragments do not remain in memory. If the
							evaluator finds a 32-or-greater-consecutive-bit fragment, then fail immediately.
							Otherwise, there is a chance that it is not within the context of a key (e.g., some
							random bits that happen to match). If this is the case the test should be repeated
							with a different key in Step #1. If a fragment is also found in this repeated run
							then the test fails unless the developer provides a reasonable explanation for the
							collision, then the evaluator may give a pass on this test.<p></p>
						</li>
						<li><b>Test 2: </b>
							Applied to each key and keying material held in non-volatile memory and
							subject to destruction by overwrite by the TOE.<ol type="1">
							<li>Record the value of the key or keying material.</li>
							<li>Cause the TOE to perform normal cryptographic processing with the key
								from Step #1.</li>
							<li>Search the non-volatile memory the key was stored in for instances of the
								known key value from Step #1. <p></p>
								Note that the primary purpose of Step #3 is to demonstrate that appropriate

							<li>Cause the TOE to clear the key.</li>
							<li>Search the non-volatile memory in which the key was stored for instances
								of the known key value from Step #1. If a copy is found, then the test fails.</li>
							<li>Break the key value from Step #1 into an evaluator-chosen set of
								fragments and perform a search using each fragment. (Note that the
								evaluator shall first confirm with the developer how the key is normally
								stored, in order to choose fragment sizes that are the same or smaller than
								any fragmentation of the data that may be implemented by the TOE. The
								endianness or byte-order should also be taken into account in the search).</li>
							</ol>
							Step #6 ensures that partial key fragments do not remain in non-volatile memory.
							If the evaluator finds a 32-or-greater-consecutive-bit fragment, then fail
							immediately. Otherwise, there is a chance that it is not within the context of a key
							(e.g., some random bits that happen to match). If this is the case the test should be
							repeated with a different key in Step #1. If a fragment is also found in this
							repeated run then the test fails unless the developer provides a reasonable
							explanation for the collision, then the evaluator may give a pass on this test.
						</li>
						<li><b>Test 3: </b>
							Applied to each key and keying material held in non-volatile memory and
							subject to destruction by overwrite by the TOE.<ol type="1">
							<li>Record memory of the key or keying material.</li>
							<li>Cause the TOE to perform normal cryptographic processing with the key
								from Step #1.</li>
							<li>Cause the TOE to clear the key. Record the value to be used for the
								overwrite of the key. </li>
							<li>Examine the memory from Step #1 to ensure the appropriate pattern
								(recorded in Step #3) is used. </li>
							</ol>
							The test succeeds if correct pattern is found in the memory location. If the pattern
							is not found, then the test fails.

						The tests below are derived from the “The Secure Hash Algorithm Validation
						System (SHAVS), Updated: May 21, 2014” from the National Institute of Standards
						and Technology.<p></p>
						The TSF hashing functions can be implemented with one of two orientations. The
						first is a byte-oriented implementation: this hashes messages that are an integral
						number of bytes in length (i.e., the length (in bits) of the message to be hashed is
						divisible by 8). The second is a bit-oriented implementation: this hashes messages

						The evaluator shall perform all of the following tests for each hash algorithm and

						<b>Short Messages Test, Bit-oriented Implementation</b><p></p>
						The evaluators devise an input set consisting of m+1 messages, where m is the block

						<b>Selected Long Messages Test, Bit-oriented Implementation</b><p></p>
						The evaluators devise an input set consisting of m messages, where m is the block

						<b>Selected Long Messages Test, Byte-oriented Implementation</b><p></p>
						The evaluators devise an input set consisting of m/8 messages, where m is the block
						length of the hash algorithm in bits (see SHA Properties Table). The length of the

						messages and ensure that the correct result is produced when the messages are
						provided to the TSF.<p></p>
						<b>Pseudo-randomly Generated Messages Test</b><p></p>
						The evaluators randomly generate a seed that is n bits long, where n is the length of
						the message digest produced by the hash function to be tested. The evaluators then

						For each SHA-3-XXX implementation, XXX represents d, the digest length in bits.
						The capacity, c, is equal to 2d bits. The rate is equal to 1600-c bits.<p></p>
						65 The TSF hashing functions can be implemented with one of two orientations. The
						first is a bit-oriented mode that hashes messages of arbitrary length. The second is
						a byte-oriented mode that hashes messages that are an integral number of bytes in

						The evaluators devise an input set consisting of rate+1 short messages. The length
						of the messages ranges sequentially from 0 to rate bits. The message text shall be
						pseudo-randomly generated. The evaluators compute the message digest for each
						of the messages and ensure that the correct result is produced when the messages
						are provided to the TSF. The message of length 0 is omitted if the TOE does not

						<b>Short Messages Test, Byte-oriented Mode</b><p></p>
						The evaluators devise an input set consisting of rate/8+1 short messages. The length

						<b>Selected Long Messages Test, Bit-oriented Mode</b><p></p>
						The evaluators devise an input set consisting of 100 long messages ranging in size
						from rate+(rate+1) to rate+(100*(rate+1)), incrementing by rate+1. (For example,
						SHA-3-256 has a rate of 1088 bits. Therefore, 100 messages will be generated with
						lengths 2177, 3266, …, 109988 bits.) The message text shall be pseudo-randomly

						The evaluators devise an input set consisting of 100 messages ranging in size from
						(rate+(rate+8)) to (rate+100*(rate+8)), incrementing by rate+8. (For example,
						SHA-3-256 has a rate of 1088 bits. Therefore 100 messages will be generated of

					The evaluator shall verify the implementation of the key generation routines of the

					<b>If ECDH-NIST or ECDH-BPC is claimed:</b><p></p>
					<b>SP800-56A Key Agreement Schemes</b><p></p>
					The evaluator shall verify a TOE's implementation of SP800-56A key agreement
					schemes using the following Function and Validity tests. These validation tests for
					each key agreement scheme verify that a TOE has implemented the components of
					the key agreement scheme according to the specifications in the Recommendation.
					These components include the calculation of the DLC primitives (the shared secret
					value Z) and the calculation of the derived keying material (DKM) via the Key
					Derivation Function (KDF). If key confirmation is supported, the evaluator shall
					also verify that the components of key confirmation have been implemented
					correctly, using the test procedures described below. This includes the parsing of
					the DKM, the generation of MACdata and the calculation of MACtag.<p></p>
					<i>Function Test</i><p></p>
					The Function test verifies the ability of the TOE to implement the key agreement
					schemes correctly. To conduct this test the evaluator shall generate or obtain test
					vectors from a known good implementation of the TOE supported schemes. For
					each supported key agreement scheme-key agreement role combination, KDF type,
					and, if supported, key confirmation role-key confirmation type combination, the
					tester shall generate 10 sets of test vectors. The data set consists of one set of domain
					parameter values (FFC) or the NIST approved curve (ECC) per 10 sets of public
					keys. These keys are static, ephemeral or both depending on the scheme being
					tested.<p></p>
					The evaluator shall obtain the DKM, the corresponding TOE’s public keys (static
					or ephemeral), the MAC tags, and any inputs used in the KDF, such as the Other
					Information field OI and TOE id fields.<p></p>
					If the TOE does not use a KDF defined in SP 800-56A, the evaluator shall obtain
					only the public keys and the hashed value of the shared secret. <p></p>
					The evaluator shall verify the correctness of the TSF’s implementation of a given
					scheme by using a known good implementation to calculate the shared secret value,
					derive the keying material DKM, and compare hashes or MAC tags generated from
					these values.<p></p>
					If key confirmation is supported, the TSF shall perform the above for each
					implemented approved MAC algorithm.<p></p>
					<i>Validity Test</i><p></p>
					The Validity test verifies the ability of the TOE to recognize another party’s valid
					and invalid key agreement results with or without key confirmation. To conduct this
					test, the evaluator shall obtain a list of the supporting cryptographic functions
					included in the SP800-56A key agreement implementation to determine which
					errors the TOE should be able to recognize. The evaluator generates a set of 24
					(FFC) or 30 (ECC) test vectors consisting of data sets including domain parameter
					values or NIST approved curves, the evaluator’s public keys, the TOE’s
					public/private key pairs, MACTag, and any inputs used in the KDF, such as the
					other info and TOE id fields.<p></p>
					The evaluator shall inject an error in some of the test vectors to test that the TOE
					recognizes invalid key agreement results caused by the following fields being
					incorrect: the shared secret value Z, the DKM, the other information field OI, the
					data to be MACed, or the generated MACTag. If the TOE contains the full or partial
					(only ECC) public key validation, The evaluator shall also individually inject errors
					in both parties’ static public keys, both parties’ ephemeral public keys and the
					TOE’s static private key to assure the TOE detects errors in the public key validation
					function or the partial key validation function (in ECC only). At least two of the test
					vectors shall remain unmodified and therefore should result in valid key agreement
					results (they should pass).<p></p>
					The TOE shall use these modified test vectors to emulate the key agreement scheme
					using the corresponding parameters. The evaluator shall compare the TOE’s results
					with the results using a known good implementation verifying that the TOE detects
					these errors.<p></p>
					<b>If KAS1, KAS2, KTS-OAEP, or RSAES-PKCS1-v1_5 is claimed:</b><p></p>
					<b>SP800-56B and PKCS#1 Key Establishment Schemes</b><p></p>
					If the TOE acts as a sender, the following evaluation activity shall be performed to
					ensure the proper operation of every TOE supported combination of RSA-based
					key establishment scheme:<p></p>
					To conduct this test the evaluator shall generate or obtain test vectors from a known
					good implementation of the TOE supported schemes. For each combination of
					supported key establishment scheme and its options (with or without key
					confirmation if supported, for each supported key confirmation MAC function if
					key confirmation is supported, and for each supported mask generation function if
					KTS-OAEP is supported), the tester shall generate 10 sets of test vectors. Each test
					vector shall include the RSA public key, the plaintext keying material, any
					additional input parameters if applicable, the MacKey and MacTag if key 
					confirmation is incorporated, and the outputted ciphertext. For each test vector, the
					evaluator shall perform a key establishment encryption operation on the TOE with

					If the TOE acts as a receiver, the following evaluation activities shall be performed
					to ensure the proper operation of every TOE supported combination of RSA-based
					key establishment scheme:<p></p>
					To conduct this test the evaluator shall generate or obtain test vectors from a known
					good implementation of the TOE supported schemes. For each combination of
					supported key establishment scheme and its options (with our without key
					confirmation if supported, for each supported key confirmation MAC function if
					key confirmation is supported, and for each supported mask generation function if
					KTSOAEP is supported), the tester shall generate 10 sets of test vectors. Each test
					vector shall include the RSA private key, the plaintext keying material (KeyData),
					any additional input parameters if applicable, the MacTag in cases where key
					confirmation is incorporated, and the outputted ciphertext. For each test vector, the
					evaluator shall perform the key establishment decryption operation on the TOE and
					ensure that the outputted plaintext keying material (KeyData) is equivalent to the
					plain text keying material in the test vector. In cases where key confirmation is
					incorporated, the evaluator shall perform the key confirmation steps and ensure that
					the outputted MacTag is equivalent to the MacTag in the test vector.<p></p>
					The evaluator shall ensure that the TSS describes how the TOE handles decryption
					errors. In accordance with NIST Special Publication 800-56B, the TOE must not
					reveal the particular error that occurred, either through the contents of any outputted
					or logged error message or through timing variations. If KTS-OAEP is supported,
					the evaluator shall create separate contrived ciphertext values that trigger each of
					the three decryption error checks described in NIST Special Publication 800-56B
					section 7.2.2.3, ensure that each decryption attempt results in an error, and ensure
					that any outputted or logged error message is identical for each.<p></p>

					The evaluator shall verify the correctness of each TSF implementation of each

					<b>Curve25519:</b><p></p>
					The evaluator shall verify a TOE's implementation of the key agreement scheme
					using the following Function and Validity tests. These validation tests for each key
					agreement scheme verify that a TOE has implemented the components of the key
					agreement scheme according to the specification. These components include the
					calculation of the shared secret K and the hash of K.<p></p>
					<b>Function Test</b><p></p>
					The Function test verifies the ability of the TOE to implement the key agreement
					schemes correctly. To conduct this test the evaluator shall generate or obtain test
					vectors from a known good implementation of the TOE supported schemes. For
					each supported key agreement role and hash function combination, the tester shall
					generate 10 sets of public keys. These keys are static, ephemeral or both depending
					on the scheme being tested.<p></p>
					The evaluator shall obtain the shared secret value K, and the hash of K. The
					evaluator shall verify the correctness of the TSF’s implementation of a given
					scheme by using a known good implementation to calculate the shared secret value
					K and compare the hash generated from this value.<p></p>
					<b>Validity Test</b><p></p>
					The Validity test verifies the ability of the TOE to recognize another party’s valid
					and invalid key agreement results. To conduct this test, the evaluator generates a set
					of 30 test vectors consisting of data sets including the evaluator’s public keys and
					the TOE’s public/private key pairs.<p></p>
					The evaluator shall inject an error in some of the test vectors to test that the TOE
					recognizes invalid key agreement results caused by the following fields being
					incorrect: the shared secret value K or the hash of K. At least two of the test vectors
					shall remain unmodified and therefore should result in valid key agreement results
					(they should pass).<p></p>
					The TOE shall use these modified test vectors to emulate the key agreement scheme
					using the corresponding parameters. The evaluator shall compare the TOE’s results
					with the results using a known good implementation verifying that the TOE detects
					these errors.<p></p>

              the OS (e.g., placement in a specific directory). Instructions for
              initiating the update process, as well as discerning whether the process was
              successful or unsuccessful. This includes generation of the hash/digital signature.
              The OS will likely contain security functionality that does not
              fall in the scope of evaluation under this PP. The operational guidance shall make it
              clear to an administrator which security functionality is covered by the evaluation
              activities. </div><div class="comp" id=""><h4>AGD_PRE.1 Preparative Procedures (AGD_PRE.1)</h4>As indicated in the introduction above, there are significant expectations
              with respect to the documentation—especially when configuring the operational
              environment to support OS functional requirements. The evaluator
              shall check to ensure that the guidance provided for the OS
              adequately addresses all platforms claimed for the OS in the ST. </div><h2 class="indexable" data-level="1" id="alc">3.3 Class ALC: Life-cycle Support</h2><div class="comp" id=""><h4>ALC_CMC.1 Labeling of the TOE (ALC_CMC.1)</h4>The evaluator will check the ST to ensure that it contains
              an identifier (such as a product name/version number) that specifically identifies the
              version that meets the requirements of the ST. Further, the
              evaluator will check the AGD guidance and OS samples received for
              testing to ensure that the version number is consistent with that in the ST. If the vendor maintains a web site advertising the OS, the evaluator will examine the information on the web site to
              ensure that the information in the ST is sufficient to distinguish
              the product.</div><div class="comp" id=""><h4>ALC_CMS.1 TOE CM Coverage (ALC_CMS.1)</h4>The "evaluation evidence required by the SARs" in this PP is limited to the
              information in the ST coupled with the guidance provided to
              administrators and users under the AGD requirements. By ensuring that the OS is specifically identified and that this identification is
              consistent in the ST and in the AGD guidance (as done in the
              assurance activity for ALC_CMC.1), the evaluator implicitly confirms the information
              required by this component. Life-cycle support is targeted aspects of the developer’s
              life-cycle and instructions to providers of applications for the developer’s devices,
              rather than an in-depth examination of the TSF manufacturer’s
              development and configuration management process. This is not meant to diminish the
              critical role that a developer’s practices play in contributing to the overall
              trustworthiness of a product; rather, it’s a reflection on the information to be made
              available for evaluation. <br/> The evaluator will ensure that the developer has
              identified (in guidance documentation for application developers concerning the
              targeted platform) one or more development environments appropriate for use in
              developing applications for the developer’s platform. For each of these development
              environments, the developer shall provide information on how to configure the
              environment to ensure that buffer overflow protection mechanisms in the environment(s)
              are invoked (e.g., compiler and linker flags). The evaluator will ensure that this documentation
              also includes an indication of whether such protections are on by default, or have to
              be specifically enabled. The evaluator will ensure that the TSF is
              uniquely identified (with respect to other products from the TSF
              vendor), and that documentation provided by the developer in association with the
              requirements in the ST is associated with the TSF
              using this unique identification.</div><div class="comp" id=""><h4>ALC_TSU_EXT.1 Timely Security Updates</h4> The evaluator will verify that the TSS contains a description of the timely
              security update process used by the developer to create and deploy security updates.
              The evaluator will verify that this description addresses the entire application. The
              evaluator will also verify that, in addition to the OS developer’s process, any
              third-party processes are also addressed in the description. The evaluator will also
              verify that each mechanism for deployment of security updates is described. <br/> The
              evaluator will verify that, for each deployment mechanism described for the update
              process, the TSS lists a time between public disclosure of a vulnerability and public
              availability of the security update to the OS patching this vulnerability, to include
              any third-party or carrier delays in deployment. The evaluator will verify that this
              time is expressed in a number or range of days. <br/> The evaluator will verify that
              this description includes the publicly available mechanisms (including either an email
              address or website) for reporting security issues related to the OS. The evaluator
              shall verify that the description of this mechanism includes a method for protecting
              the report either using a public key for encrypting email or a trusted channel for a
              website. </div><h2 class="indexable" data-level="1" id="ate">3.4 Class ATE: Tests</h2><div class="comp" id=""><h4>ATE_IND.1 Independent Testing – Conformance (ATE_IND.1)</h4>The evaluator will prepare a test plan and report documenting the testing
              aspects of the system, including any application crashes during testing. The evaluator
              shall determine the root cause of any application crashes and include that information
              in the report. The test plan covers all of the testing actions contained in the 
              <a href="#bibCEM">[CEM]</a> and the body of this PP’s Assurance Activities. <br/> While it is
              not necessary to have one test case per test listed in an Assurance Activity, the
              evaluator must document in the test plan that each applicable testing requirement in
              the ST is covered. The test plan identifies the platforms to be
              tested, and for those platforms not included in the test plan but included in the
                ST, the test plan provides a justification for not testing the
              platforms. This justification must address the differences between the tested
              platforms and the untested platforms, and make an argument that the differences do not
              affect the testing to be performed. It is not sufficient to merely assert that the
              differences have no affect; rationale must be provided. If all platforms claimed in
              the ST are tested, then no rationale is necessary. The test plan
              describes the composition of each platform to be tested, and any setup that is
              necessary beyond what is contained in the AGD documentation. It should be noted that
              the evaluator is expected to follow the AGD documentation for installation and setup
              of each platform either as part of a test or as a standard pre-test condition. This
              may include special test drivers or tools. For each driver or tool, an argument (not
              just an assertion) should be provided that the driver or tool will not adversely
              affect the performance of the functionality by the OS and its
              platform. <br/> This also includes the configuration of the cryptographic engine to be
              used. The cryptographic algorithms implemented by this engine are those specified by
              this PP and used by the cryptographic protocols being evaluated (IPsec, TLS). The test
              plan identifies high-level test objectives as well as the test procedures to be
              followed to achieve those objectives. These procedures include expected results. <br/>
              The test report (which could just be an annotated version of the test plan) details
              the activities that took place when the test procedures were executed, and includes
              the actual results of the tests. This shall be a cumulative account, so if there was a
              test run that resulted in a failure; a fix installed; and then a successful re-run of
              the test, the report would show a “fail” and “pass” result (and the supporting
              details), and not just the “pass” result.</div><h2 class="indexable" data-level="1" id="ava">3.5 Class AVA: Vulnerability Assessment</h2><div class="comp" id=""><h4>AVA_VAN.1 Vulnerability Survey (AVA_VAN.1)</h4>The evaluator will generate a report to document their
              findings with respect to this requirement. This report could physically be part of the
              overall test report mentioned in ATE_IND, or a separate document. The evaluator
              performs a search of public information to find vulnerabilities that have been found
              in similar applications with a particular focus on network protocols the application
              uses and document formats it parses. 
              The evaluator documents the sources consulted and
              the vulnerabilities found in the report. 
              <br/>
              For each vulnerability found, the evaluator
              either provides a rationale with respect to its non-applicability, or the evaluator
              formulates a test (using the guidelines provided in ATE_IND) to confirm the
              vulnerability, if suitable. Suitability is determined by assessing the attack vector
              needed to take advantage of the vulnerability. If exploiting the vulnerability
              requires expert skills and an electron microscope, for instance, then a test would not
              be suitable and an appropriate justification would be formulated.</div><h1 id="sup-info" class="indexable" data-level="0">4 Required Supplementary Information</h1><p>This Supporting Document has no required supplementary information beyond the ST, operational
