            The scope of this Protection Profile (PP) is to describe the security functionality of virtualization technologies in 
			terms of [CC] and to define security functional and assurance requirements for such products. This PP is not complete 
			in itself, but rather provides a set of requirements that are common to the PP-Modules for Server
			Virtualization and for Client Virtualization. These capabilities have been broken out into this generic ‘base’ PP due
			to the high degree of similarity between the two product types.<h:p/>
            Due to the increasing prevalence of virtualization technology in enterprise computing environments and the shift
			to cloud computing, it is essential to ensure that this technology is implemented securely in order to mitigate
			the risk introduced by sharing multiple computers and their resident data across a single physical system.

	<!-- 1.3 Compliant Targets of Evaluation -->
		<section id="s-complianttargets" title="Compliant Targets of Evaluation">
				A Virtualization System (VS) is a software product that enables multiple independent computing systems to execute on the 
			same physical hardware platform without interference from one another. A VS creates a virtualized hardware environment
			(virtual machines or VMs) for each instance of an operating system permitting these environments to execute 
			concurrently while maintaining isolation and the appearance of exclusive control over assigned computing resources.
			For the purposes of this document, the VS consists of a Virtual Machine Manager (VMM), Virtual Machine (VM) 
			abstractions, a management subsystem, and other components.<h:p/>
				A VMM is a collection of software components responsible for enabling VMs to function as expected by the software
			executing within them. Generally, the VMM consists of a Hypervisor, Service VMs, and other components of the VS,
			such as virtual devices, binary translation systems, and physical device drivers. It manages concurrent execution of 
			all VMs and virtualizes platform resources as needed.<h:p/>
				The Hypervisor is the software executive of the physical platform of a VS. A hypervisor operates at 
			the highest CPU privilege level and manages access to all of the physical resources of the hardware platform. It
			exports a well-defined, protected interface for access to the resources it manages. A Hypervisor’s primary function is 
			to mediate access to all CPU and memory resources, but it is also responsible for either the direct management or the
			delegation of the management of all other hardware devices on the hardware platform. This document does not specify
			any Hypervisor-specific requirements, though many VMM requirements would naturally apply to a Hypervisor.<h:p/>
				A Service VM is a VM whose purpose is to support the Hypervisor in providing the resources or services necessary to
			support Guest VMs. Service VMs may implement some portion of Hypervisor functionality, but also may contain important
			system functionality that is not necessary for Hypervisor operation. As with any VM, Service VMs necessarily execute
			without full Hypervisor privileges—only the privileges required to perform its designed functionality. Examples of 
			Service VMs include device driver VMs that manage access to physical devices, VMs that provide life-cycle management and 
			provisioning of Hypervisor and Guest VMs, and name-service VMs that help establish 
			communication paths between VMs.<h:p/>
				A Guest VM is a VM that contains a virtual environment for the execution of an independent computing system. Virtual 
			environments execute mission workloads and implement customer-specific client or server functionality in Guest VMs, 
			such as a web server or desktop productivity applications. A Helper VM is a VM that performs services on behalf of
			one or more Guest VMs, but does not qualify as a Service VM—and therefore is not part of the VMM. Helper VMs implement
			functions or services that are particular to the workloads of Guest VMs. For example, a VM that provides a virus 
			scanning service for a Guest VM would be considered a Helper VM. The line between Helper and Service VMs can easily
			be blurred. For instance, a VM that implements a cryptographic function—such as an in-line encryption VM—could be 
			identified as either a Service or Helper VM depending on the particular virtualization solution. If the cryptographic
			functions are necessary only for the privacy of Guest VM data in support of the Guest’s mission applications, it would
			be proper to classify the encryption VM as a Helper. But if the encryption VM is necessary for the VMM to isolate
			Guest VMs, it would be proper to classify the encryption VM as a Service 
			VM. For the purposes of this document, Helper VMs are subject to all requirements
			that apply to Guest VMs, unless specifically stated otherwise.<h:p/>
			
			<!-- 1.3.1 TOE Boundary -->
			<section id="ss-toeboundary" title="TOE Boundary">
				Figure 1 shows a greatly simplified view of a generic Virtualization System and Platform. TOE components are displayed
				in Red. Non-TOE components are in Blue. The Platform is the hardware, firmware, and software onto which the VS is 
				installed. The VMM includes the Hypervisor, Service VMs, and VM containers, but not the software that runs inside
				Guest VMs or Helper VMs. The Management Subsystem is part of the TOE, but may or may not be part of the VMM. 
				<h:br></h:br><h:br></h:br>

				<figure entity="images/figure1.png" title="Virtualization System and Platform " id="vsplatform"/><h:br/><h:br/>
    
				For purposes of this Protection Profile, the Virtualization System is the TOE, subject to some caveats. The Platform
				onto which the VS is installed (which includes hardware, platform firmware, and Host Operating System) is not
				part of the TOE. Software installed with the VS on the Host OS specifically to support the VS
				or implement VS functionality is part of the TOE. General purpose software—such as device drivers for physical 
				devices and the Host OS itself—is not part of the TOE, regardless of whether it supports VS functionality or 
				runs inside a Service VM or control domain. Software that runs within Guest and Helper VMs is not part of the 
				TOE.<h:br></h:br><h:br></h:br>
					In general, for virtualization products that are installed onto “bare metal,” the entire set of installed components
				constitute the TOE, and the hardware constitutes the Platform. Also in general, for products that are hosted by or
				integrated into a commodity operating system, the components installed expressly for implementing and supporting
				virtualization are in the TOE, and the Platform comprises the hardware and Host OS.
			</section>
		
			<!-- 1.3.2 Requirements Met by the Platform -->
			<section id="ss-platformreqs" title="Requirements Met by the Platform">
				Depending on the way the VS is installed, functions tested under this PP may be implemented by the TOE or by the
				Platform. There is no difference in the testing required whether the function is implemented by the TOE or by the
				Platform. In either case, the tests determine whether the function being tested provides a level of confidence 
				acceptable to meet the goals of this Profile with respect to a particular product and platform. The equivalency 
				guidelines are intended in part to address this TOE vs. Platform distinction, and to ensure that confidence 
				in the evaluation results do not erode between instances of equivalent products on equivalent platforms—and also, of course, to
				ensure that the appropriate testing is done when the distinction is significant.
			</section>
		
			<!-- 1.3.3 Scope of Certification -->
			<section id="ss-scopecert" title="Scope of Certification">
				Successful evaluation of a Virtualization System against this profile does not constitute or imply successful 
				evaluation of any Host Operating System or Platform—no matter how tightly integrated with the VS. The Platform,
				including any Host OS, supports the VS through provision of services and resources. Specialized VS components 
				installed on or in a Host OS to support the VS may be considered part of the TOE. But general-purpose OS
				components and functions—whether or not they support the VS—are not part of the TOE, and thus
				are not evaluated under this PP.
			</section>
		
			<!-- 1.3.4 Product and Platform Equivalance -->
			<section id="ss-equiv" title="Product and Platform Equivalence">
				The tests in this Protection Profile must be run on all product versions and Platforms with which the Vendor would 
				like to claim compliance—subject to this Profile’s equivalency guidelines (see <xref to="appendix-equiv"/>).

                    It is a fundamental property of VMs that the domains encapsulated by different VMs remain separate unless

                        It shall be possible to configure VMs such that data cannot be moved between domains from VM to VM, or

                        If it is possible for data to leak between domains when prohibited by policy, then an adversary on one domain

                    <description>VMs are the fundamental subject of the system. The VMM is 
                        responsible for applying the system security policy (SSP) to the VM and 
                        all resources. As basic functionality, the VMM must support a security policy that mandates 
                        no information transfer between VMs.<h:br></h:br><h:br></h:br>
                        The VMM must support the necessary mechanisms to isolate the resources of all 
                        VMs. The VMM partitions a platform's physical resources for use by the 
                        supported virtual environments. Depending on customer requirements, a VM may need a completely 
                        isolated environment with exclusive access to system resources or share some of its resources with other 
                        VMs. It must be possible to enforce a security policy that prohibits the transfer of data 
                        between VMs through shared devices. When the platform security policy allows the sharing of 
                        resources across VM boundaries, the VMM must ensure that all access to 
                        those resources is consistent with the policy. The VMM may delegate the responsibility for 
                        the mediation of resource sharing to select Service VMs; however in doing so, 
                        it remains responsible for mediating access to the Service VMs, and each Service 
                        VM must mediate all access to any shared resource that has been delegated to it in 
                        accordance with the SSP.<h:br></h:br><h:br></h:br>
                        Both virtual and physical devices are resources requiring access control. The VMM must 
                        enforce access control in accordance with system security policy. Physical devices are platform devices with 
                        access mediated via the VMM per the O.VMM_Integrity objective. Virtual devices may include 
                        virtual storage devices and virtual network devices. Some of the access control restrictions must be enforced
                        internal to Service VMs, as may be the case for isolating virtual networks. 
                        VMMs may also expose purely virtual interfaces. These are VMM specific, 
                        and while they are not analogous to a physical device, they are also subject to access control.<h:br>

                        The VMM must support the mechanisms to isolate all resources associated with virtual 
                        networks and to limit a VM's access to only those virtual networks for which it has been 
                        configured. The VMM must also support the mechanisms to control the configurations of 
                        virtual networks according to the SSP.

                    <description>VMM management functions include VM configuration, virtualized 
                        network configuration, allocation of physical resources, and reporting. Only authorized users 
                        (administrators) may exercise management functions.<h:p/>
                        Because of the privileges exercised by the VMM management functions, it must not be possible 
                        for the VMM’s management components to be compromised without administrator notification. 
                        This means that unauthorized users cannot be permitted access to the management functions, and the management 
                        components must not be interfered with by Guest VMs or unprivileged users on other 
                        networks—including operational networks connected to the TOE.<h:p/> 
			VMMs include a set of management functions that collectively allow administrators 
                        to configure and manage the VMM, as well as configure Guest VMs. These 
                        management functions are specific to the VS and are distinct from any other management functions 
                        that might exist for the internal management of any given Guest VM. These 
                        VMM management functions are privileged, with the security of the entire system relying on 
                        their proper use. The VMM management functions can be classified into different categories 
                        and the policy for their use and the impact to security may vary accordingly.<h:p/>
                        The management functions are distributed throughout the VMM (within the 
                        VMM and Service VMs). The VMM must support the necessary 
                        mechanisms to enable the control of all management functions according to the system security policy. When a 
                        management function is distributed among multiple Service VMs, the VMs 
                        must be protected using the security mechanisms of the Hypervisor and any Service VMs 
                        involved to ensure that the intent of the system security policy is not compromised. Additionally, since 
                        hypercalls permit Guest VMs to invoke the Hypervisor, and often allow the passing of data 
                        to the Hypervisor, it is important that the hypercall interface is well-guarded and that all parameters be 
                        validated.<h:br></h:br><h:br></h:br> The VMM maintains configuration data for every 
                        VM on the system. This configuration data, whether of Service or Guest VMs,
                        must be protected. The mechanisms used to establish, modify and verify configuration data are part of the VS 
                        management functions and must be protected as such. The proper internal configuration of Service 
                        VMs that provide critical security functions can also greatly impact VS security. These 
                        configurations must also be protected. Internal configuration of Guest VMs should not 
                        impact overall VS security. The overall goal is to ensure that the VMM, including the 
                        environments internal to Service VMs, is properly configured and that all Guest 
                        VM configurations are maintained consistent with the system security policy throughout 
                        their lifecycle.<h:br></h:br><h:br></h:br> Virtualization Systems are often managed remotely. For 
                        example, an administrator can remotely update virtualization software, start and shut down 
                        VMs, and manage virtualized network connections. If a console is required, it could be 
                        run on a separate machine or it could itself run in a VM. When performing remote management, 
                        an administrator must communicate with a privileged management agent over a network. Communications with the 
                        management infrastructure must be protected from Guest VMs and operational networks.

                                The evaluator shall verify a TOE's implementation of SP800-56A key agreement schemes using the following 
					Function and Validity tests. These validation tests for each key agreement scheme verify that a TOE has
					implemented the components of the key agreement scheme according to the specifications in the
					Recommendation. These components include the calculation of the DLC primitives (the shared secret
					value Z) and the calculation of the derived keying material (DKM) via the Key Derivation Function 
					(KDF). If key confirmation is supported, the evaluator shall also verify that the components of key
					confirmation have been implemented correctly, using the test procedures described below. This includes
					the parsing of the DKM, the generation of MACdata and the calculation of MACtag.<h:br></h:br><h:br></h:br>
                                <h:i>Function Test</h:i><h:br></h:br><h:br></h:br>
                                The Function test verifies the ability of the TOE to implement the key agreement schemes correctly. To conduct 
					this test, the evaluator shall generate or obtain test vectors from a known good implementation of 
					the TOE supported schemes. For each supported key agreement scheme-key agreement role combination, KDF
					type, and, if supported, key confirmation role- key confirmation type combination, the tester shall 
					generate 10 sets of test vectors. The data set consists of one set of domain parameter values (FFC) or 
					the NIST approved curve (ECC) per 10 sets of public keys. These keys are static, ephemeral, or both
					depending on the scheme being tested.<h:br></h:br><h:br></h:br>
                                The evaluator shall obtain the DKM, the corresponding TOE’s public keys (static and ephemeral), the
					MAC tags, and any inputs used in the KDF, such as the Other Information field OI and TOE ID fields.<h:br></h:br><h:br></h:br>
                                If the TOE does not use a KDF defined in SP 800-56A, the evaluator shall obtain only the public keys 
					and the hashed value of the shared secret.<h:br></h:br><h:br></h:br>
                                The evaluator shall verify the correctness of the TSF’s implementation of a given scheme by using a 
					known good implementation to calculate the shared secret value, derive the keying material DKM,
					and compare hashes or MAC tags generated from these values.<h:br></h:br><h:br></h:br>
                                If key confirmation is supported, the TSF shall perform the above for each implemented approved MAC 
					algorithm.<h:br></h:br><h:br></h:br>
                                <h:i>Validity Test</h:i><h:br></h:br><h:br></h:br>
                                The Validity test verifies the ability of the TOE to recognize another party’s valid and invalid key 
					agreement results with or without key confirmation. To conduct this test, the evaluator shall 
					obtain a list of the supporting cryptographic functions included in the SP800-56A key agreement
					implementation to determine which errors the TOE should be able to recognize. The evaluator
					generates a set of 24 (FFC) or 30 (ECC) test vectors consisting of data sets including domain
					parameter values or NIST approved curves, the evaluator’s public keys, the TOE’s public/private
					key pairs, MACTag, and any inputs used in the KDF, such as the other info and TOE ID fields.<h:br></h:br><h:br></h:br>
                                The evaluator shall inject an error in some of the test vectors to test that the TOE recognizes
					invalid key agreement results caused by the following fields being incorrect: the shared secret
					value Z, the DKM, the other information field OI, the data to be MACed, or the generated MACTag.
					If the TOE contains the full or partial (only ECC) public key validation, the evaluator will also 
					individually inject errors in both parties’ static public keys, both parties’ ephemeral public
					keys and the TOE’s static private key to assure the TOE detects errors in the public key 
					validation function and the partial key validation function (in ECC only). At least two of the
					test vectors shall remain unmodified and therefore should result in valid key agreement results
					(they should pass).<h:br></h:br><h:br></h:br>
                                The TOE shall use these modified test vectors to emulate the key agreement scheme using the 
					corresponding parameters. The evaluator shall compare the TOE’s results with the results using 
					a known good implementation verifying that the TOE detects these errors.<h:br></h:br><h:br></h:br>

							from volatile memory by unauthorized processes.<h:br></h:br><h:br></h:br>
                            The TSF must destroy or cause to be destroyed all copies of cryptographic keys created and
							managed by the TOE once the keys are no longer needed. This requirement is the same for all instances
							of keys within TOE volatile memory regardless of whether the memory is controlled by TOE manufacturer 
							software or by third-party TOE modules. The evaluation activities are designed with flexibility to
							address cases where the TOE manufacturer has limited insight into the behavior of third-party TOE 
							components.<h:br></h:br><h:br></h:br>
							The preferred method for destroying keys in TOE volatile memory is by direct overwrite of the memory
							occupied by the keys. The values used for overwriting can be all zeros, all ones, or any other pattern
							or combination of values significantly different than the value of the key itself such that the keys
							are rendered inaccessible to running processes.<h:br></h:br><h:br></h:br>
                            Some implementations may find that direct overwriting of memory is not feasible or possible due to 
							programming language constraints. Many memory- and type-safe languages provide no mechanism for
							programmers to specify that a particular memory location be accessed or written. The value of such
							languages is that it is much harder for a programming error to result in a buffer or heap overflow.
							The downside is that multiple copies of keys might be scattered throughout language-runtime memory. 
							In such cases, the TOE should take whatever actions are feasible to cause the keys to become
							inaccessible—freeing memory, destroying objects, closing applications, programming using the minimum 
							possible scope for variables containing keys.<h:br></h:br><h:br></h:br>
                            Likewise, if keys reside in memory within the execution context of a third-party module, then the 
							TOE should take whatever feasible actions it can to cause the keys to be destroyed.<h:br></h:br><h:br></h:br>
                            Cryptographic keys in non-TOE volatile memory are not covered by this requirement. This expressly includes 
							keys created and used by Guest VMs. The Guest is responsible for disposing of such keys.

							at this time due to the way some storage technologies are implemented (e.g., wear-leveling of flash

							non-volatile storage media are necessarily outside the TOE boundary. Thus, the TOE manufacturer is
							likely to have little control over—or insight into—the functioning of these storage devices. The 
							TOE must make a “best-effort” to destroy disused cryptographic keys by invoking the 
							appropriate platform interfaces—recognizing that the specific actions taken by the platform are out of
							the TOE’s control.<h:br></h:br><h:br></h:br>
                            But in cases where the TOE has insight into the non-volatile storage technologies used by the platform,

							pattern of any static value, or by a block erase.<h:br></h:br><h:br></h:br>
                            For keys stored on encrypted media, it is sufficient for the media encryption keys to be destroyed for

                                This test is for byte-oriented implementations only. The evaluators randomly generate a
                                seed that is n bits long, where n is the length of the message digest produced by the
                                hash function to be tested. The evaluators then formulate a set of 100 messages and
                                associated digests by following the algorithm provided in Figure 1 of [SHAVS]. The
                                evaluators then ensure that the correct result is produced when the messages are
                                provided to the TSF.<h:br></h:br><h:br></h:br>
								<h:b><h:u>SHA-3 Tests</h:u></h:b>
								The tests below are derived from the The Secure Hash Algorithm-3 Validation System (SHA3VS), 
								Updated: April 7, 2016, from the National Institute of Standards and Technology.<h:br/><h:br/>
								For each SHA-3-XXX implementation, XXX represents d, the digest length in bits. The capacity, c,
								is equal to 2d bits. The rate is equal to 1600-c bits.  <h:br/><h:br/>
								The TSF hashing functions can be implemented with one of two orientations. The first is a bit-oriented
								mode that hashes messages of arbitrary length. The second is a byte-oriented mode that hashes messages 
								that are an integral number of bytes in length (i.e., the length (in bits) of the message to be
								hashed is divisible by 8). Separate tests for each orientation are given below. <h:br/><h:br/>
								The evaluator shall perform all of the following tests for each hash algorithm and orientation
								implemented by the TSF and used to satisfy the requirements of this PP. The evaluator shall
								compare digest values produced by a known-good SHA-3 implementation against those generated by
								running the same values through the TSF.<h:br/><h:br/><h:br/><h:br/>
								<h:b>Short Messages Test, Bit-oriented Mode</h:b><h:br/><h:br/>
								The evaluators devise an input set consisting of rate+1 short messages. The length of the messages
								ranges sequentially from 0 to rate bits. The message text shall be pseudorandomly generated. The
								evaluators compute the message digest for each of the messages and ensure that the correct result
								is produced when the messages are provided to the TSF. The message of length 0 is omitted if the
								TOE does not support zero-length messages.<h:br/><h:br/><h:br/>
								<h:b>Short Messages Test, Byte-oriented Mode</h:b><h:br/><h:br/>
								The evaluators devise an input set consisting of rate/8+1 short messages. The length of the
								messages ranges sequentially from 0 to rate/8 bytes, with each message being an integral number of 
								bytes. The message text shall be pseudorandomly generated. The evaluators compute the message
								digest for each of the messages and ensure that the correct result is produced when the messages
								are provided to the TSF. The message of length 0 is omitted if the TOE does not support zero-length
								messages.<h:br/><h:br/><h:br/>
								<h:b>Selected Long Messages Test, Bit-oriented Mode</h:b><h:br/><h:br/>
								The evaluators devise an input set consisting of 100 long messages ranging in size from 
								rate+(rate+1) to rate+(100*(rate+1)), incrementing by rate+1. (For example, SHA-3-256 has a rate
								of 1088 bits. Therefore, 100 messages will be generated with lengths 2177, 3266, …, 109988 bits.)
								The message text shall be pseudorandomly generated. The evaluators compute the message digest for
								each of the messages and ensure that the correct result is produced when the messages are provided
								to the TSF.<h:br/><h:br/><h:br/>
								<h:b>Selected Long Messages Test, Byte-oriented Mode</h:b><h:br/><h:br/>
								The evaluators devise an input set consisting of 100 messages ranging in size from (rate+(rate+8))
								to (rate+100*(rate+8)), incrementing by rate+8. (For example, SHA-3-256 has a rate of 1088 bits.
								Therefore 100 messages will be generated of lengths 2184, 3280, 4376, …, 110688 bits.) The message
								text shall be pseudorandomly generated. The evaluators compute the message digest for each of the
								messages and ensure that the correct result is produced when the messages are provided to the TSF.<h:br/><h:br/><h:br/>
								<h:b>Pseudorandomly Generated Messages Monte Carlo) Test, Byte-oriented Mode</h:b><h:br/><h:br/>
								The evaluators supply a seed of d bits (where d is the length of the message digest produced by
								the hash function to be tested. This seed is used by a pseudorandom function to generate 100,000 
								message digests. One hundred of the digests (every 1000th digest) are recorded as checkpoints. The
								TOE then uses the same procedure to generate the same 100,000 message digests and 100 checkpoint
								values. The evaluators then compare the results generated to ensure that the correct result is
								produced when the messages are generated by the TSF.<h:br/><h:br/>

                                There are four Known Answer Tests (KATs), described below. In all KATs, the plaintext, ciphertext,
								and IV values shall be 128-bit blocks. The results from each test may either be obtained by the 
								evaluator directly or by supplying the inputs to the implementer and receiving the results in 
								response. To determine correctness, the evaluator shall compare the resulting values to those 
								obtained by submitting the same inputs to a known good implementation.
                                <h:br></h:br><h:br></h:br>

								be encrypted with a 128-bit all-zeros key, and the other five shall be encrypted with a 256-bit
								all-zeros key.

								and the other five shall be 256-bit keys.<h:br></h:br><h:br></h:br>

								shall have the leftmost i bits be ones and the rightmost N-i bits be zeros, for i in [1,N].<h:br></h:br><h:br></h:br>
                                To test the decrypt functionality of AES-CBC, the evaluator shall supply the two sets of key and
								ciphertext value pairs described below and obtain the plaintext value that results from AES-CBC
								decryption of the given ciphertext using the given key and an IV of all zeros. The first set of
								key/ciphertext pairs shall have 128 128-bit key/ciphertext pairs, and the second set of 
								key/ciphertext pairs shall have 256 256-bit key/ciphertext pairs. Key i in each set shall have 
								the leftmost i bits be ones and the rightmost N-i bits be zeros, for i in [1,N]. The ciphertext
								value in each pair shall be the value that results in an all-zeros plaintext when decrypted with
								its corresponding key.<h:br></h:br><h:br></h:br>

								encryption of the given plaintext using a 128-bit key value of all zeros with an IV of all zeros 
								and using a 256-bit key value of all zeros with an IV of all zeros, respectively. Plaintext value
								i in each set shall have the leftmost i bits be ones and the rightmost 128-i bits be zeros, for i
								in [1,128].<h:br></h:br><h:br></h:br>
                                To test the decrypt functionality of AES-CBC, the evaluator shall perform the same test as for
								encrypt, using ciphertext values of the same form as the plaintext in the encrypt test as input
								and AES-CBC decryption.<h:br></h:br><h:br></h:br>

                                </h:b><h:br></h:br><h:br></h:br>
                                The evaluator shall test the encrypt functionality by encrypting an i-block message
                                where 1 &lt; i &#2264; 10 <!--   1 < i <=10-->. The evaluator shall choose a key, an IV and plaintext
								message of length i blocks and encrypt the message, using the mode to be tested, with the chosen
								key and IV. The ciphertext shall be compared to the result of encrypting the same plaintext message
								with the same key and IV using a known good implementation.<h:br></h:br><h:br></h:br>
                                The evaluator shall also test the decrypt functionality for each mode by decrypting an
                                i-block message where 1 &lt; i &#2264; 10 <!--   1 < i <=10 -->. The evaluator shall choose a key,
								an IV and a ciphertext message of length i blocks and decrypt the message, using the mode to be
								tested, with the chosen key and IV. The plaintext shall be compared to the result of decrypting
								the same ciphertext message with the same key and IV using a known good implementation.<h:br></h:br><h:br></h:br>
								<h:b>AES-CBC Monte Carlo Tests</h:b><h:br></h:br><h:br></h:br>
                                The evaluator shall test the encrypt functionality using a set of 200 plaintext, IV, and key 3-tuples.
								100 of these shall use 128 bit keys, and 100 shall use 256 bit keys. The plaintext and IV values
								shall be 128-bit blocks. For each 3-tuple, 1000 iterations shall be run as follows:<h:br></h:br><h:br></h:br>
                                <!--  code -->
                                <h:pre>
                                    # Input: PT, IV, Key
                                    for i = 1 to 1000:
                                        if i == 1:
                                            CT[1] = AES-CBC-Encrypt(Key, IV, PT)
                                            PT = IV
                                        else:

                                <!-- end code -->
                                The ciphertext computed in the 1000th iteration (i.e., CT[1000]) is the result for that trial. This 
								result shall be compared to the result of running 1000 iterations with the same values using a
								known good implementation.<h:br></h:br><h:br></h:br>
											The evaluator shall test the decrypt functionality using the same test as for encrypt, exchanging CT

				              Known Answer Tests (KATs)
					      <h:p/>
					      There are four Known Answer Tests (KATs) described below.  For all KATs, the plaintext,
					      initialization vector (IV), and ciphertext values shall be 128-bit blocks.  The results from each test may
					      either be obtained by the validator directly or by supplying the inputs to the implementer
					      and receiving the results in response.  To determine correctness, the evaluator shall
					      compare the resulting values to those obtained by submitting the same inputs to a known
					      good implementation.
				              <h:p/>
					      <h:b>Test 1a:</h:b> To test the encrypt functionality, the evaluator shall supply a set of 10 plaintext 
					      values and obtain the ciphertext value that results from encryption of the given plaintext
					      using a key value of all zeros and an IV of all zeros.  Five plaintext values shall be encrypted
					      with a 128-bit all zeros key, and the other five shall be encrypted with a 256-bit all zeros key. 
					      To test the decrypt functionality, the evaluator shall perform the same 
					      test as for encrypt, using 10 ciphertext values as input.
					      <h:p/>
					      <h:b>Test 1b:</h:b> To test the encrypt functionality, the evaluator shall supply a set of 10 key values
					      and obtain the ciphertext value that results from encryption of an all zeros plaintext
					      using the given key value and an IV of all zeros.  Five of the key values shall be 128-bit
					      keys, and the other five shall be 256-bit keys. To test the decrypt functionality, the
					      evaluator shall perform the same test as for encrypt, using an all zero ciphertext
					      value as input.
					      <h:p/>
					      <h:b>Test 1c:</h:b> To test the encrypt functionality, the evaluator shall supply the two sets of key values
					      described below and obtain the ciphertext values that result from AES encryption of an
					      all zeros plaintext using the given key values and an IV of all zeros.  The first set of
					      keys shall have 128 128-bit keys, and the second shall have 256 256-bit keys.  Key_i in
					      each set shall have the leftmost i bits be ones and the rightmost N-i bits be zeros,
					      for i in [1, N]. To test the decrypt functionality, the evaluator shall supply the two
					      sets of key and ciphertext value pairs described below and obtain the plaintext value
					      that results from decryption of the given ciphertext using the given key values and an
					      IV of all zeros.  The first set of key/ciphertext pairs shall have 128 128-bit
					      key/ciphertext pairs, and the second set of key/ciphertext pairs shall have 256 256-bit
					      pairs. Key_i in each set shall have the leftmost i bits be ones and the rightmost N-i
					      bits be zeros for i in [1, N].  The ciphertext value in each pair shall be the value 
					      that results in an all zeros plaintext when decrypted with its corresponding key.
					      <h:p/>
					      <h:b>Test 1d:</h:b> To test the encrypt functionality, the evaluator shall supply the set of
					      128 plaintext values described below and obtain the two ciphertext values that
					      result from encryption of the given plaintext using a 128-bit key value of all
					      zeros and using a 256 bit key value of all zeros, respectively, and an IV of all
					      zeros. Plaintext value i in each set shall have the leftmost bits be ones and
					      the rightmost 128-i bits be zeros, for i in [1, 128].  To test the decrypt functionality,
					      the evaluator shall perform the same test as for encrypt, using ciphertext
					      values of the same form as the plaintext in the encrypt test as input.
					      <h:p/>
					    </test>
					    <test>
					      Multi-Block Message Test
					      <h:p/>
					      The evaluator shall test the encrypt functionality by encrypting an i-block 
					      message where 1 less-than i less-than-or-equal to 10. For each i the evaluator 
					      shall choose a key, IV, and plaintext message of length i blocks and encrypt
					      the message, using the mode to be tested, with the chosen key. The ciphertext
					      shall be compared to the result of encrypting the same plaintext message with
					      the same key and IV using a known good implementation. The evaluator shall also 
					      test the decrypt functionality by decrypting an i-block message where 1 less-than
					      i less-than-or-equal to 10. For each i the evaluator shall choose a key and
					      a ciphertext message of length i blocks and decrypt the message, using the mode 
					      to be tested, with the chosen key. The plaintext shall be compared to the result
					      of decrypting the same ciphertext message with the same key using a known good implementation.
					      <h:p/>
					    </test>
					    <test>
					      Monte-Carlo Test
					      <h:p/>
					      For AES-CTR mode perform the Monte Carlo Test for ECB Mode on the encryption 
					      engine of the counter mode implementation. There is no need to test the decryption engine.
					      <h:p/>
					      The evaluator shall test the encrypt functionality using 200 plaintext/key pairs. 
					      100 of these shall use 128 bit keys, and 100 of these shall use 256 bit keys.  
					      The plaintext values shall be 128-bit blocks.  For each pair, 1000 iterations shall be run as follows:
					      <h:p/>
					      For AES-ECB mode<h:br />
					      # Input: PT, Key<h:br />
					      for i = 1 to 1000:<h:br />
					      CT[i] = AES-ECB-Encrypt(Key, PT)<h:br />
					      PT = CT[i]
					      <h:p/>
					      The ciphertext computed in the 1000th iteration is the result for that 
					      trial.  This result shall be compared to the result of running 1000 
					      iterations with the same values using a known good implementation.  
					    </test>
					  </testlist>
					    If "invoke platform-provided" is selected, the evaluator confirms that SSH connections are only successful if appropriate algorithms and appropriate key sizes are configured. To do this, the evaluator shall perform the following tests:
					    <testlist>
					      <test>
						[Conditional: TOE is an SSH server] The evaluator shall configure an SSH client to connect with an invalid cryptographic algorithm and key size for each listening SSH socket connection on the TOE.  
						The evaluator initiates SSH client connections to each listening SSH socket connection on the TOE and observes that the connection fails in each attempt.
					      </test>
					    <test>
					      [Conditional: TOE is an SSH client] The evaluator shall configure a listening SSH socket on a remote SSH server that accepts only invalid cryptographic algorithms and keys. 
					      The evaluator uses the TOE to attempt an SSH connection to this server and observes that the connection fails.

                            This requirement ensures that sufficient entropy is available to any VM that requires it. The entropy 
							need not provide high-quality entropy for every possible method that a VM might acquire it. The VMM
							must, however, provide some means for VMs to get sufficient entropy. For example, the VMM can
							provide an interface that returns entropy to a Guest VM. Alternatively, the VMM could provide 
							pass-through access to entropy sources provided by the host platform.<h:br></h:br><h:br></h:br>
                            This requirement allows for three general ways of providing entropy to guests: 1) The VS can provide a 
							Hypercall accessible to VM-aware guests, 2) access to a virtualized device that provides entropy, or 
							3) pass-through access to a hardware entropy source (including a source of random numbers). In all 
							cases, it is possible that the guest is made VM-aware through installation of software or drivers.
							For the second and third cases, it is possible that the guest could be VM-unaware. There is no
							requirement that the TOE provide entropy sources as expected by VM-unaware guests. That is, the TOE
							does not have to anticipate every way a guest might try to acquire entropy as long as it supplies a
							mechanism that can be used by VM-aware guests, or provides access to a standard mechanism that a 
							VM-unaware guest would use.<h:br></h:br><h:br></h:br>
                            The ST author should select “Hypercall interface” if the TSF provides an API function through which 
							guest-resident software can obtain entropy or random numbers. The ST author should select 
							“virtual device interface” if the TSF presents a virtual device interface to the Guest OS through
							which it can obtain entropy or random numbers. Such an interface could present a virtualized real
							device, such as a TPM, that can be accessed by VM-unaware guests, or a virtualized fictional device
							that would require the Guest OS to be VM-aware. The ST author should select “passthrough access to 
							hardware entropy source” if the TSF permits Guest VMs to have direct access to hardware entropy or
							random number source on the platform. The ST author should select all items that are appropriate.<h:br></h:br><h:br></h:br>
                            For FCS_ENT_EXT.1.2, the VMM must ensure that the provision of entropy to one VM cannot affect the quality
							of entropy provided to another VM on the same platform.

							This SFR is included in the ST if the ST Author selected "IPsec" in FTP_ITC_EXT.1.1.<h:br/><h:br/>
							RFC 4301 calls for an IPsec implementation to protect IP traffic through the use
							of a Security Policy Database (SPD). The SPD is used to define how IP packets are
							to be handled: PROTECT the packet (e.g., encrypt the packet), BYPASS the IPsec
							services (e.g., no encryption), or DISCARD the packet (e.g., drop the packet). The
							SPD can be implemented in various ways, including router access control lists,
							firewall rulesets, a "traditional" SPD, etc. Regardless of the implementation
							details, there is a notion of a "rule" that a packet is "matched" against and a
							resulting action that takes place. <h:br/><h:br/>
								While there must be a means to order the rules, a general approach to ordering
							is not mandated, as long as the TOE can distinguish the IP packets and apply the
							rules accordingly. There may be multiple SPDs (one for each network interface),
							but this is not required. <h:br/><h:br/>

								If the TOE boundary includes a general-purpose operating system or mobile device, the evaluator shall

							<Guidance>
								In addition to the Operational Guidance EAs for the individual FCS_IPSEC_EXT.1 elements below, the
								evaluator shall perform the following:<h:p/>
								If the configuration of the IPsec behavior is from an environmental source, most notably a VPN gateway
								(e.g through receipt of required connection parameters from a VPN gateway), the evaluator shall ensure
								that the operational guidance contains any appropriate information for ensuring that this configuration
								can be properly applied.<h:p/>
								Note in this case that the implementation of the IPsec protocol must be enforced entirely within the TOE
								boundary; i.e. it is not permissible for a software application TOE to be a graphical front-end for IPsec
								functionality implemented totally or in part by the underlying OS platform. The behavior referenced here
								is for the possibility that the configuration of the IPsec connection is initiated from outside the TOE, which
								is permissible so long as the TSF is solely responsible for enforcing the configured behavior. However, it is
								allowable for the TSF to rely on low-level platform-provided networking functions to implement the SPD
								from the client (e.g., enforcement of packet routing decisions).<h:p/>

							<Tests>
								As a prerequisite for performing the Test EAs for the individual FCS_IPSEC_EXT.1 elements below, the
								evaluator shall do the following:<h:p/>
								The evaluator shall minimally create a test environment equivalent to the test environment illustrated
								below. The traffic generator used to construct network packets should provide the
								evaluator with the ability manipulate fields in the ICMP, IPv4, IPv6, UDP, and TCP packet headers. The
								evaluator shall provide justification for any differences in the test environment.<h:p/>

                                The evaluator shall examine the TSS and determine that it describes how the IPsec capabilities
				    are implemented.<h:p/>
				The evaluator shall ensure that the TSS describes at a high level the architectural relationship between
				    the IPsec implementation and the rest of the TOE (e.g., is the IPsec implementation an integrated part 
				    of the VS or is it a standalone executable that is bundled into the VS).<h:p/> 		    
				The evaluator shall ensure that the TSS describes how the SPD is implemented and the rules for processing
				both inbound and outbound packets in terms of the IPsec policy. The TSS describes the rules that are
				available and the resulting actions available after matching a rule. The TSS describes how the available
				rules and actions form the SPD using terms defined in RFC 4301 such as BYPASS (e.g., no encryption),
				DISCARD (e.g., drop the packet), and PROTECT (e.g., encrypt the packet) actions defined in RFC 4301.
				<h:p/>
                                As noted in section 4.4.1 of RFC 4301, the processing of entries in the SPD is non-trivial and the evaluator
				shall determine that the description in the TSS is sufficient to determine which rules will be applied given
				the rule structure implemented by the TOE. For example, if the TOE allows specification of ranges,
				conditional rules, etc., the evaluator shall determine that the description of rule processing (for both
				inbound and outbound packets) is sufficient to determine the action that will be applied, especially in the
				case where two different rules may apply. This description shall cover both the initial packets (that is, no
				SA is established on the interface or for that particular packet) as well as packets that are part of an

                                The evaluator shall examine the operational guidance to verify it instructs the Administrator how 
                                to construct entries into the SPD that specify a rule for processing a packet. The description 
                                includes all three cases – a rule that ensures packets are encrypted/decrypted, dropped, and 
                                flow through the TOE without being encrypted. The evaluator shall determine 
                                that the description in the operational guidance is consistent with the description in the 
                                TSS, and that the level of detail in the operational guidance is sufficient to
                                allow the administrator to set up the SPD in an unambiguous fashion. This includes a discussion 
                                of how ordering of rules impacts the processing of an IP packet.<h:p/>

                                    <test>The evaluator shall configure the SPD such that there is a rule for dropping a packet,

					the construction of the rule shall be different such that the evaluator can generate a
					packet and send packets to the gateway with the appropriate fields (fields that are used
					by the rule - e.g., the IP addresses, TCP/UDP ports) in the packet header. The evaluator
					performs both positive and negative test cases for each type of rule (e.g., a packet that
					matches the rule and another that does not match the rule). The evaluator observes via the
					audit trail, and packet captures that the TOE exhibited the expected
					behavior: appropriate packets were dropped, allowed to flow without modification,

					cover include rules with overlapping ranges and conflicting entries, inbound and outbound
					packets, and packets that establish SAs as well as packets that belong to established SAs.

				appropriately. From the RFC “A difference between IKEv1 and IKEv2 is that in IKEv1 SA lifetimes were
				negotiated. In IKEv2, each end of the SA is responsible for enforcing its own lifetime policy on the SA and
				rekeying the SA when necessary. If the two ends have different lifetime policies, the end with the shorter
				lifetime will end up always being the one to request the rekeying. If the two ends have the same lifetime
				policies, it is possible that both will initiate a rekeying at the same time (which will result in redundant
				SAs). To reduce the probability of this happening, the timing of rekeying requests SHOULD be jittered.”<h:p/>

						certificate that will be revoked (for each method chosen in the selection) to ensure when the certificate
						    is no longer valid that the TOE will not establish an SA.</test>

						fields and uses the preferred logic outlined in the Application Note, the tests above with the Common
						Name field shall be performed using peer certificates with no SAN extension. Additionally, the evaluator

					    <test>[conditional]: If the TOE supports DN identifier types, the evaluator shall configure the peer's

					    <test>[conditional]: If the TOE supports both IPv4 and IPv6 and supports IP address identifier types, the
						evaluator must repeat test 1 and 2 with both IPv4 address identifiers and IPv6 identifiers. Additionally,
						the evaluator shall verify that the TOE verifies that the IP header matches the identifiers by setting the

						    address of the peer in the IP headers and verifying that the IKE authentication fails.</test>
					<test>[conditional]: If, according to the TSS, the TOE performs comparisons between the peer’s ID
						payload and the peer’s certificate, the evaluator shall repeat the following test for each combination of

				verification that the peer identified by the ID payload and the certificate is the
				peer expected by the TOE (per the reference identifier). At that time, the TOE will
				be required to demonstrate both aspects (i.e. that the TOE enforces that the
				peer’s ID payload matches the peer’s certificate which both match configured
				peer reference identifiers).<h:p/>
				Excluding the DN identifier type (which is necessarily the Subject DN in the peer
				certificate), the TOE may support the identifier in either the Common Name or
				Subject Alternative Name (SAN) or both. If both are supported, the preferred
				logic is to compare the reference identifier to a presented SAN, and only if the
				peer’s certificate does not contain a SAN, to fall back to a comparison against
				the Common Name. In the future, the TOE will be required to compare the
				reference identifier to the presented identifier in the SAN only, ignoring the
				Common Name.<h:p/>

				FMT_SMF.1.1/VPN. <h:p/>

                                statement in the first element) is identified to an Administrator.<h:p/> 
				The evaluator shall ensure that the TSS describes how the Guest VM is associated with each 
                                physical resource, and how other Guest VMs cannot access a physical resource
                                without being granted explicit access. For TOEs that implement a robust 
                                interface (other than just "allow access" or "deny access"), the evaluator shall ensure that the
                                TSS describes the possible operations or modes of access between a Guest 
                                VM's and physical platform resources.<h:br></h:br><h:br></h:br>
                                If physical resources are listed in the second element, the evaluator shall examine the 
                                TSS and operational guidance to determine that there appears to be no way to
                                configure those resources for access by a Guest VM. The evaluator shall
                                document in the evaluation report their analysis of why the controls offered to configure access
                                to physical resources can't be used to specify access to the resources identified in the second 
                                element (for example, if the interface offers a drop-down list of resources to assign, and the
                                denied resources are not included on that list, that would be sufficient justification in the

                                VMs for each platform allowed in the evaluated configuration according to the

                                those resources listed in the second and third elements of the component and notes that access to 
                                these resources is explicitly denied/allowed, respectively.

                            Removable media is media that can be ejected from a device, such as a compact disc, floppy disk, SD, or
				compact flash memory card.<h:br></h:br><h:br></h:br>
                            Removable media devices are removable devices that include media, such as USB flash drives and USB hard
				drives. Removable media devices can themselves contain removable media (e.g., USB CDROM drives).<h:br></h:br><h:br></h:br>
                            For purposes of this requirement, an Information Domain is:

                            These requirements also apply to virtualized removable media—such as virtual CD drives that connect to
				ISO images—as well as physical media—such as CDROMs and USB flash drives. In the case of virtual
				CDROMs, virtual ejection of the virtual media is sufficient.<h:br></h:br><h:br></h:br>
                            In the first assignment, the ST author lists all removable media and removable media devices (both virtual
				and real) that are supported by the TOE. The ST author then
				selects actions that are appropriate for all removable media and removable media devices (both 
				virtual and real) that are being claimed in the assignment.<h:br></h:br><h:br></h:br>
                            For clarity, the ST author may iterate this requirement so that like actions are grouped with the 
				removable media or devices to which they apply (e.g., the first iteration could contain all devices
				for which media is ejected on a switch; the second iteration could contain all devices for which 
				access is prevented on a switch, etc.).

                            “Update” in the context of this SFR refers to the process of replacing a non-volatile, system resident
				software component with another. The former is referred to as the NV image, and the latter is the
				update image. While the update image is typically newer than the NV image, this is not a requirement.
				There are legitimate cases where the system owner may want to rollback a component to an older version
				(e.g., when the component manufacturer releases a faulty update, or when the system relies on an 
				undocumented feature no longer present in the update). Likewise, the owner may want to update with the
				same version as the NV image to recover from faulty storage.<h:br></h:br><h:br></h:br>
                            All discrete software components (e.g., applications, drivers, kernel, firmware) of the TSF, should be 
				digitally signed by the corresponding manufacturer and subsequently verified by the mechanism
				performing the update. Since it is recognized that components may be signed by different manufacturers,
				it is essential that the update process verify that both the update and NV images were produced by the 
				same manufacturer (e.g., by comparing public keys) or signed by legitimate signing keys (e.g.,
				successful verification of certificates when using X.509 certificates).<h:br></h:br><h:br></h:br>
                            The Digital Signature option is the preferred mechanism for authenticating updates. The Published Hash
				option will be removed from a future version of this PP.

							is that a firmware update of a single VM must not affect other VMs. So if multiple VMs share the same
							firmware image as part of a common hardware abstraction, then the update of a single machine’s BIOS 
							must not be allowed to change the common abstraction. The virtual hardware abstraction is part of the

	<!-- 5.2 Security Assurance Requirements -->
        <section id="s-sar" title="Security Assurance Requirements">
            The Security Objectives for the TOE in Section 4 were constructed to address threats identified in Section 3.1. The 
		Security Functional Requirements (SFRs) in Section 5.1 are a formal instantiation of the Security Objectives. The PP
		identifies the Security Assurance Requirements (SARs) to frame the extent to which the evaluator assesses the
		documentation applicable for the evaluation and performs independent testing.<h:p/>
            This section lists the set of Security Assurance Requirements (SARs) from Part 3 of the Common Criteria for Information 
		Technology Security Evaluation, Version 3.1, Revision 5 that are required in evaluations against this PP. Individual
		evaluation activities to be performed are specified in both Section 5.1 as well as in this section.<h:p/>
            After the ST has been approved for evaluation, the Information Technology Security Evaluation Facility (ITSEF) will obtain
		the TOE, supporting environmental IT, and the administrative/user guides for the TOE. The ITSEF is expected to perform
		actions mandated by the CEM for the ASE and ALC SARs. The ITSEF also performs the evaluation activities contained 
		within Section 5, which are intended to be an interpretation of the other CEM assurance requirements as they apply 
		to the specific technology instantiated in the TOE. The evaluation activities that are captured in Section 5 also 
		provide clarification as to what the developer needs to provide to demonstrate the TOE is compliant with the PP.

				    plan but included in the ST, the test plan provides a justification for not
				    testing the platforms. This justification must address the differences between the tested platforms
				    and the untested platforms, and make an argument that the differences do not affect the testing to
				    be performed. It is not sufficient to merely assert that the differences have no affect; rationale
				    must be provided. If all platforms claimed in the ST are tested, then no 
				    rationale is necessary.<h:br></h:br><h:br></h:br>
                                The test plan describes the composition of each platform to be tested, and any setup that is necessary
				    beyond what is contained in the AGD documentation. It should be noted that the evaluators are
				    expected to follow the AGD documentation for installation and setup of each platform either as
				    part of a test or as a standard pre-test condition. This may include special test drivers or
				    tools. For each driver or tool, an argument (not just an assertion) is provided that the driver or 
				    tool will not adversely affect the performance of the functionality by the TOE and its platform.
				    This also includes the configuration of cryptographic engines to be used. The cryptographic 
				    algorithms implemented by these engines are those specified by this PP and used by the 
				    cryptographic protocols being evaluated (IPsec, TLS/HTTPS, SSH).<h:br></h:br><h:br></h:br>
                                The test plan identifies high-level test objectives as well as the test procedures to be followed to 
				    achieve those objectives. These procedures include expected results. The test report (which could
				    just be an annotated version of the test plan) details the activities that took place when the
				    test procedures were executed, and includes the actual results of the tests. This shall be a 
				    cumulative account, so if there was a test run that resulted in a failure; a fix installed; and
				    then a successful re-run of the test, the report would show a “fail” and “pass” result (and the
				    supporting details), and not just the “pass” result.

				by assessing the attack vector needed to take advantage of the vulnerability. For example, if the
				vulnerability can be detected by pressing a key combination on boot-up, a test would be suitable at

    <!-- Appendix F: Equivalency Guidelines -->
    <appendix id="appendix-equiv" title="Equivalency Guidelines">
        <section id="s-vm-intro" title="Introduction">
          The purpose of equivalence in PP-based evaluations is to find a balance between evaluation rigor and commercial
            practicability--to ensure that evaluations meet customer expectations while recognizing that there is little to be gained
            from requiring that every variation in a product or platform be fully tested. If a product is found to be compliant with
            a PP on one platform, then all equivalent products on equivalent platforms are also considered to be compliant with the PP.
        <h:br />
        <h:br />
        A Vendor can make a claim of equivalence if the Vendor believes that a particular instance of their Product implements
            PP-specified security functionality in a way equivalent to the implementation of the same functionality on another
            instance of their Product on which the functionality was tested. The Product instances can differ in version number or
            feature level (model), or the instances may run on different platforms. Equivalency can be used to reduce the testing
            required across claimed evaluated configurations. It can also be used during Assurance Maintenance to reduce testing
            needed to add more evaluated configurations to a certification.
      <h:br />
      <h:br />
      These equivalency guidelines do not replace Assurance Maintenance requirements or NIAP Policy #5 requirements for CAVP
            certificates. Nor may equivalency be used to leverage evaluations with expired certifications.
      <h:br />
      <h:br />
      This document provides guidance for determining whether Products and Platforms are equivalent for purposes of
            evaluation against the Protection Profile for Virtualization (VPP) when instantiated with either the Client or Server
            PP-Module.
      <h:br />
      <h:br />
      Equivalence has two aspects:
      <h:br />
      <h:ol>
        <h:li><h:b><h:i>Product Equivalence:</h:i></h:b> Products may be considered equivalent if there are no
          differences between Product Models and Product Versions with respect to PP-specified security functionality.</h:li>
        <h:li><h:b><h:i>Platform Equivalence:</h:i></h:b> Platforms may be considered equivalent if there are no
          significant differences in the services they provide to the Product--or in the way the platforms
          provide those services--with respect to PP-specified security functionality.</h:li>
      </h:ol>
      The equivalency determination is made in accordance with these guidelines by the Validator and Scheme using information
            provided by the Evaluator/Vendor.
    </section>
    <section id="s-approach" title="Approach to Equivalency Analysis">
      There are two scenarios for performing equivalency analysis. One is when a product has been certified and the vendor
      wants to show that a later product should be considered certified due to equivalence with the earlier product. The
      other is when multiple product variants are going though evaluation together and the vendor would like to reduce
      the amount of testing that must be done. The basic rules for determining equivalence are the same in both cases.
      But there is one additional consideration that applies to equivalence with previously certified products. That is,
      the product with which equivalence is being claimed must have a valid certification in accordance with scheme rules
      and the Assurance Maintenance process must be followed. If a product’s certification has expired, then equivalence
      cannot be claimed with that product.
      <h:br /><h:br />
      When performing equivalency analysis, the Evaluator/Vendor should first use the factors and guidelines for Product
      Model equivalence to determine the set of Product Models to be evaluated. In general, Product Models that do not differ
      in PP-specified security functionality are considered equivalent for purposes of evaluation against the VPP.
      <h:br /><h:br />
      If multiple revision levels of Product Models are to be evaluated--or to determine whether a revision of an evaluated
      product needs re-evaluation--the Evaluator/Vendor and Validator should use the factors and guidelines for Product
      Version equivalence to determine whether Product Versions are equivalent.
      <h:br /><h:br />
      Having determined the set of Product Models and Versions to be evaluated, the next step is to determine the set of
      Platforms that the Products must be tested on.
      <h:br /><h:br />
      Each non-equivalent Product for which compliance is claimed must be fully tested on each non-equivalent platform
      for which compliance is claimed. For non-equivalent Products on equivalent platforms, only the differences that
      affect PP-specified security functionality must be tested for each product.
      <h:br /><h:br />
      If the set of equivalent Products includes only bare-metal installations, then the equivalency analysis is complete.
        But if any members of the set include hosted installations or installations that integrate with an existing host operating
        system or control domain, then software platform equivalence must be taken into consideration. The Evaluator/Vendor and
        Validator should use the factors and guidance for software platform equivalence to determine whether different models or
        versions of host or control domain operating systems require separate testing.<h:br /><h:br />
      <h:b><h:i>“Differences in PP-Specified Security Functionality” Defined</h:i></h:b>
      <h:br />
      If PP-specified security functionality is implemented by the TOE, then differences in the actual implementation
      between versions or product models break equivalence for that feature. Likewise, if the TOE implements the
      functionality in one version or model and the functionality is implemented by the platform in another version
      or model, then equivalence is broken. If the functionality is implemented by the platform in multiple models or
      versions on equivalent platforms, then the functionality is considered different if the product invokes the platform
      differently to perform the function.
    </section>
    <section id="s-modelequiv" title="Specific Guidance for Determining Product Model Equivalence">
      Product Model equivalence attempts to determine whether different feature levels of the same product across
      a product line are equivalent for purposes of PP testing. For example, if a product has a “basic” edition and an “enterprise”
      edition, is it necessary to test both models? Or does testing one model provide sufficient confidence that both models
      are compliant?

    <section id="s-platformequiv" title="Specific Guidance for Determining Platform Equivalence">
      Platform equivalence is used to determine the platforms that a product must be tested on. These guidelines are divided
        into sections for determining hardware equivalence and software (host OS/control domain) equivalence. If the Product is
        installed onto bare metal, then only hardware equivalence is relevant. If the Product is installed onto an OS—or is integrated
        into an OS—then both hardware and software equivalence are required. Likewise, if the Product can be installed either on bare
        metal or on an operating system, both hardware and software equivalence are relevant.
      <h:br /><h:br />
      <section id="ss-hardware-equiv" title="Hardware Platform Equivalence">
        If a Virtualization Solution runs directly on hardware without an operating system, then platform equivalence is based primarily
          on processor architecture and instruction sets.
        <h:br /><h:br />
        Platforms with different processor architectures and instruction sets are not equivalent. This is probably
          not an issue because there is likely to be a different product model for different hardware environments.
        <h:br /><h:br />
        Equivalency analysis becomes important when comparing platforms with the same processor architecture. Processors
          with the same architecture that have instruction sets that are subsets or supersets of each other are not disqualified
          from being equivalent for purposes of a VPP evaluation. If the VS takes the same code paths when executing PP-specified
          security functionality on different processors of the same family, then the processors can be considered equivalent with
          respect to that application.
        <h:br /><h:br />
        For example, if a VS follows one code path on platforms that support the AES-NI instruction and another on platforms that do
          not, then those two platforms are not equivalent with respect to that VS functionality. But if the VS follows the same code
          path whether or not the platform supports AES-NI, then the platforms are equivalent with respect to that functionality.
        <h:br /><h:br />
        The platforms are equivalent with respect to the VS if the platforms are equivalent with respect to all PP-specified

        If the Product installs onto or integrates with an operating system that is not installed with the product--and thus

        The guidance for Product Model (Section 3) specifies that Products intended for use on substantially different operating
          systems (e.g., Windows vs. Linux vs. SunOS) are different Models. Therefore, platforms running substantially different
          operating systems are not equivalent. Likewise, operating systems with different major version numbers are not
          equivalent for purposes of this PP.

      In order to make equivalency determinations, the vendor and evaluator must agree on the equivalency claims. They must
      then provide the scheme with sufficient information about the TOE instances and platforms that were evaluated, and the
      TOE instances and platforms that are claimed to be equivalent.
      <h:br /><h:br />
      The ST must describe all configurations evaluated down to processor manufacturer, model number, and microarchitecture version.
      <h:br /><h:br />
      The information regarding claimed equivalent configurations depends on the platform that the VS was developed for and runs on.
      <h:br /><h:br />
      <h:b>Bare-Metal VS</h:b>
      <h:br /><h:br />
      For VSes that run without an operating system on bare-metal or virtual bare-metal, the claimed configuration must
      describe the platform down to the specific processor manufacturer, model number, and microarchitecture version. The Vendor
      must describe the differences in the TOE with respect to PP-specified security functionality and how the TOE operates
      differently to leverage platform differences (e.g., instruction set extensions) in the tested configuration versus the
      claimed equivalent configuration.
      <h:br /><h:br />
      <h:b>VS with OS Support</h:b>
      <h:br /><h:br />
      For VSes that run on an OS host or with the assistance of an OS, then the claimed configuration must describe the OS down to
        its specific model and version number. The Vendor must describe the differences in the TOE with respect to PP-specified
        security functionality and how the TOE functions differently to leverage platform differences in the tested configuration
        versus the claimed equivalent configuration.
