    to describe the security functionality of 
    
    products in terms of 
    [CC] and to define functional and assurance requirements for them.

    </p><p> 
Although Evaluation Activities are defined mainly for the evaluators to follow, in general they also help developers to prepare for evaluation by identifying specific requirements for their TOE.
    The specific requirements in Evaluation Activities may in some cases clarify the meaning of Security
    Functional Requirements (SFR), and may identify particular requirements for the content of Security
    Targets (ST) (especially the TOE Summary Specification), user guidance documentation, and possibly
    supplementary information (e.g. for entropy analysis or cryptographic key management architecture).</p><h2 id="structure" class="indexable" data-level="1">1.2 Structure of the Document</h2><p>Evaluation Activities can be defined for both SFRs and Security Assurance Requirements (SAR),
    which are themselves defined in separate sections of the SD.</p><p>If any Evaluation Activity cannot be successfully completed in an evaluation, then
    the overall verdict for the evaluation is a 'fail'.
    In rare cases there may be acceptable reasons why an Evaluation Activity
    may be modified or deemed not applicable for a particular TOE, 
    but this must be approved by the Certification Body for the evaluation.</p><p>In general, if all Evaluation Activities (for both SFRs and SARs) are successfully
    completed in an evaluation then it would be expected that the overall verdict for 
    the evaluation is a ‘pass’.
    To reach a ‘fail’ verdict when the Evaluation Activities have been successfully 
    completed would require a specific justification from the evaluator as to why the 
    Evaluation Activities were not sufficient for that TOE.
    </p><p>Similarly, at the more granular level of assurance components, if the Evaluation 
    Activities for an assurance component and all of its related SFR Evaluation 
    Activities are successfully completed in an evaluation then it would be expected 
    that the verdict for the assurance component is a ‘pass’.
    To reach a ‘fail’ verdict for the assurance component when these Evaluation 
    Activities have been successfully completed would require a specific justification 
    from the evaluator as to why the Evaluation Activities were not sufficient for that TOE.

    the evaluator must ensure there is specific information that satisfies the EA. 
    For findings regarding the TSS section, the evaluator’s verdicts will be 
    associated with the CEM workunit ASE_TSS.1-1.
    Evaluator verdicts associated with the supplementary evidence will also be 
    associated with ASE_TSS.1-1, 
    since the requirement to provide such evidence is specified in ASE in the PP.</p><p>For ensuring the guidance documentation provides sufficient information for 
    the administrators/users as it pertains to SFRs, the evaluator’s verdicts will

    that testing of the product in the context of the associated SFR is necessary.
    While the evaluator is expected to develop tests, there may be instances where 
    it is more practical for the developer to construct tests, or where the 
    developer may have existing tests. 
    Therefore, it is acceptable for the evaluator to witness developer-generated 
    tests in lieu of executing the tests. 
    In this case, the evaluator must ensure the developer’s tests are executing both 
    in the manner declared by the developer and as mandated by the EA.

              the OS (e.g., placement in a specific directory). Instructions for
              initiating the update process, as well as discerning whether the process was
              successful or unsuccessful. This includes generation of the hash/digital signature.
              The OS will likely contain security functionality that does not
              fall in the scope of evaluation under this PP. The operational guidance shall make it
              clear to an administrator which security functionality is covered by the evaluation
              activities. </div><div class="comp" id=""><h4>AGD_PRE.1 Preparative Procedures (AGD_PRE.1)</h4><div class="component-activity-header">AGD_PRE.1</div>As indicated in the introduction above, there are significant expectations
              with respect to the documentation—especially when configuring the operational
              environment to support OS functional requirements. The evaluator
              shall check to ensure that the guidance provided for the OS
              adequately addresses all platforms claimed for the OS in the ST. </div><h1 class="indexable" data-level="1" id="alc">3.3 Class ALC: Life-cycle Support</h1><div class="comp" id=""><h4>ALC_CMC.1 Labeling of the TOE (ALC_CMC.1)</h4><div class="component-activity-header">ALC_CMC.1</div>The evaluator will check the ST to ensure that it contains
              an identifier (such as a product name/version number) that specifically identifies the
              version that meets the requirements of the ST. Further, the
              evaluator will check the AGD guidance and OS samples received for
              testing to ensure that the version number is consistent with that in the ST. If the vendor maintains a web site advertising the OS, the evaluator will examine the information on the web site to
              ensure that the information in the ST is sufficient to distinguish
              the product.</div><div class="comp" id=""><h4>ALC_CMS.1 TOE CM Coverage (ALC_CMS.1)</h4><div class="component-activity-header">ALC_CMS.1</div>The "evaluation evidence required by the SARs" in this PP is limited to the
              information in the ST coupled with the guidance provided to
              administrators and users under the AGD requirements. By ensuring that the OS is specifically identified and that this identification is
              consistent in the ST and in the AGD guidance (as done in the
              assurance activity for ALC_CMC.1), the evaluator implicitly confirms the information
              required by this component. Life-cycle support is targeted aspects of the developer’s
              life-cycle and instructions to providers of applications for the developer’s devices,
              rather than an in-depth examination of the TSF manufacturer’s
              development and configuration management process. This is not meant to diminish the
              critical role that a developer’s practices play in contributing to the overall
              trustworthiness of a product; rather, it’s a reflection on the information to be made
              available for evaluation. <br/> The evaluator will ensure that the developer has
              identified (in guidance documentation for application developers concerning the
              targeted platform) one or more development environments appropriate for use in
              developing applications for the developer’s platform. For each of these development
              environments, the developer shall provide information on how to configure the
              environment to ensure that buffer overflow protection mechanisms in the environment(s)
              are invoked (e.g., compiler and linker flags). The evaluator will ensure that this documentation
              also includes an indication of whether such protections are on by default, or have to
              be specifically enabled. The evaluator will ensure that the TSF is
              uniquely identified (with respect to other products from the TSF
              vendor), and that documentation provided by the developer in association with the
              requirements in the ST is associated with the TSF
              using this unique identification.</div><div class="comp" id=""><h4>ALC_TSU_EXT.1 Timely Security Updates</h4><div class="component-activity-header">ALC_TSU_EXT.1</div> The evaluator will verify that the TSS contains a description of the timely
              security update process used by the developer to create and deploy security updates.
              The evaluator will verify that this description addresses the entire application. The
              evaluator will also verify that, in addition to the OS developer’s process, any
              third-party processes are also addressed in the description. The evaluator will also
              verify that each mechanism for deployment of security updates is described. <br/> The
              evaluator will verify that, for each deployment mechanism described for the update
              process, the TSS lists a time between public disclosure of a vulnerability and public
              availability of the security update to the OS patching this vulnerability, to include
              any third-party or carrier delays in deployment. The evaluator will verify that this
              time is expressed in a number or range of days. <br/> The evaluator will verify that
              this description includes the publicly available mechanisms (including either an email
              address or website) for reporting security issues related to the OS. The evaluator
              shall verify that the description of this mechanism includes a method for protecting
              the report either using a public key for encrypting email or a trusted channel for a
              website. </div><h1 class="indexable" data-level="1" id="ate">3.4 Class ATE: Tests</h1><div class="comp" id=""><h4>ATE_IND.1 Independent Testing – Conformance (ATE_IND.1)</h4><div class="component-activity-header">ATE_IND.1</div>The evaluator will prepare a test plan and report documenting the testing
              aspects of the system, including any application crashes during testing. The evaluator
              shall determine the root cause of any application crashes and include that information
              in the report. The test plan covers all of the testing actions contained in the 
              <a href="#bibCEM">[CEM]</a> and the body of this PP’s Assurance Activities. <br/> While it is
              not necessary to have one test case per test listed in an Assurance Activity, the
              evaluator must document in the test plan that each applicable testing requirement in
              the ST is covered. The test plan identifies the platforms to be
              tested, and for those platforms not included in the test plan but included in the
                ST, the test plan provides a justification for not testing the
              platforms. This justification must address the differences between the tested
              platforms and the untested platforms, and make an argument that the differences do not
              affect the testing to be performed. It is not sufficient to merely assert that the
              differences have no affect; rationale must be provided. If all platforms claimed in
              the ST are tested, then no rationale is necessary. The test plan
              describes the composition of each platform to be tested, and any setup that is
              necessary beyond what is contained in the AGD documentation. It should be noted that
              the evaluator is expected to follow the AGD documentation for installation and setup
              of each platform either as part of a test or as a standard pre-test condition. This
              may include special test drivers or tools. For each driver or tool, an argument (not
              just an assertion) should be provided that the driver or tool will not adversely
              affect the performance of the functionality by the OS and its
              platform. <br/> This also includes the configuration of the cryptographic engine to be
              used. The cryptographic algorithms implemented by this engine are those specified by
              this PP and used by the cryptographic protocols being evaluated (IPsec, TLS). The test
              plan identifies high-level test objectives as well as the test procedures to be
              followed to achieve those objectives. These procedures include expected results. <br/>
              The test report (which could just be an annotated version of the test plan) details
              the activities that took place when the test procedures were executed, and includes
              the actual results of the tests. This shall be a cumulative account, so if there was a
              test run that resulted in a failure; a fix installed; and then a successful re-run of
              the test, the report would show a “fail” and “pass” result (and the supporting
              details), and not just the “pass” result.</div><h1 class="indexable" data-level="1" id="ava">3.5 Class AVA: Vulnerability Assessment</h1><div class="comp" id=""><h4>AVA_VAN.1 Vulnerability Survey (AVA_VAN.1)</h4><div class="component-activity-header">AVA_VAN.1</div>The evaluator will generate a report to document their
              findings with respect to this requirement. This report could physically be part of the
              overall test report mentioned in ATE_IND, or a separate document. The evaluator
              performs a search of public information to find vulnerabilities that have been found
              in similar applications with a particular focus on network protocols the application
              uses and document formats it parses. 
              The evaluator documents the sources consulted and
              the vulnerabilities found in the report. 
              <br/>
              For each vulnerability found, the evaluator
              either provides a rationale with respect to its non-applicability, or the evaluator
              formulates a test (using the guidelines provided in ATE_IND) to confirm the
              vulnerability, if suitable. Suitability is determined by assessing the attack vector
              needed to take advantage of the vulnerability. If exploiting the vulnerability
              requires expert skills and an electron microscope, for instance, then a test would not
              be suitable and an appropriate justification would be formulated.</div><h1 id="sup-info" class="indexable" data-level="0">4 Required Supplementary Information</h1><p>This Supporting Document has no required supplementary information beyond the ST, operational
