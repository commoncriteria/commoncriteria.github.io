    PP-Module for Virtual Private Network (VPN) Clients is
    to describe the security functionality of 
      Virtual Private Network (VPN) Clients products in terms of 
    [CC] and to define functional and assurance requirements for them.

    
    The PP-Module is intended for use with the following Base-PPs:
        <ul><li><a href="https://www.niap-ccevs.org/Profile/Info.cfm?PPID=442&amp;id=442">Protection Profile for General Purpose Operating Systems,
        version 
        4.2.1</a></li><li><a href="https://www.niap-ccevs.org/Profile/Info.cfm?PPID=417&amp;id=417">Mobile Device Fundamentals,
        version 
        3.2</a></li><li><a href="https://www.niap-ccevs.org/Profile/Info.cfm?PPID=429&amp;id=429">Protection Profile for Application Software,
        version

        version 
        4.0d-Draft</a></li></ul><br/>
    This SD is mandatory for evaluations of TOEs that claim conformance to a PP-Configuration that includes the PP-Module for :
    <ul><li>Virtual Private Network (VPN) Clients, Version 2.4</li></ul>
    As such it defines Evaluation Activities for the functionality described in the PP-Module as well as any impacts to the Evaluation Activities to the Base-PP(s) it modifies.
    </p><p> 
Although Evaluation Activities are defined mainly for the evaluators to follow, in general they also help developers to prepare for evaluation by identifying specific requirements for their TOE.
    The specific requirements in Evaluation Activities may in some cases clarify the meaning of Security
    Functional Requirements (SFR), and may identify particular requirements for the content of Security
    Targets (ST) (especially the TOE Summary Specification), user guidance documentation, and possibly
    supplementary information (e.g. for entropy analysis or cryptographic key management architecture).</p><h2 id="structure" class="indexable" data-level="1">1.2 Structure of the Document</h2><p>Evaluation Activities can be defined for both SFRs and Security Assurance Requirements (SAR),
    which are themselves defined in separate sections of the SD.</p><p>If any Evaluation Activity cannot be successfully completed in an evaluation, then
    the overall verdict for the evaluation is a 'fail'.
    In rare cases there may be acceptable reasons why an Evaluation Activity
    may be modified or deemed not applicable for a particular TOE, 
    but this must be approved by the Certification Body for the evaluation.</p><p>In general, if all Evaluation Activities (for both SFRs and SARs) are successfully
    completed in an evaluation then it would be expected that the overall verdict for 
    the evaluation is a ‘pass’.
    To reach a ‘fail’ verdict when the Evaluation Activities have been successfully 
    completed would require a specific justification from the evaluator as to why the 
    Evaluation Activities were not sufficient for that TOE.
    </p><p>Similarly, at the more granular level of assurance components, if the Evaluation 
    Activities for an assurance component and all of its related SFR Evaluation 
    Activities are successfully completed in an evaluation then it would be expected 
    that the verdict for the assurance component is a ‘pass’.
    To reach a ‘fail’ verdict for the assurance component when these Evaluation 
    Activities have been successfully completed would require a specific justification 
    from the evaluator as to why the Evaluation Activities were not sufficient for that TOE.

    to address technology specific aspects covering specific SARs (e.g. ASE_TSS.1, 
    ADV_FSP.1, AGD_OPE.1, and ATE_IND.1) – this is in addition to the CEM workunits 
    that are performed in Section <a href="#sar_aas" class="dynref">3 Evaluation Activities for SARs</a>.</p><p>Regarding design descriptions (designated by the subsections labeled TSS, as 
    well as any required supplementary material that may be treated as proprietary), 
    the evaluator must ensure there is specific information that satisfies the EA. 
    For findings regarding the TSS section, the evaluator’s verdicts will be 
    associated with the CEM workunit ASE_TSS.1-1.
    Evaluator verdicts associated with the supplementary evidence will also be 
    associated with ASE_TSS.1-1, 
    since the requirement to provide such evidence is specified in ASE in the PP.</p><p>For ensuring the guidance documentation provides sufficient information for 
    the administrators/users as it pertains to SFRs, the evaluator’s verdicts will 
    be associated with CEM workunits ADV_FSP.1-7, AGD_OPE.1-4, and AGD_OPE.1-5.</p><p>Finally, the subsection labeled Tests is where the authors have determined 
    that testing of the product in the context of the associated SFR is necessary.
    While the evaluator is expected to develop tests, there may be instances where 
    it is more practical for the developer to construct tests, or where the 
    developer may have existing tests. 
    Therefore, it is acceptable for the evaluator to witness developer-generated 
    tests in lieu of executing the tests. 
    In this case, the evaluator must ensure the developer’s tests are executing both 
    in the manner declared by the developer and as mandated by the EA. 
    The CEM workunits that are associated with the EAs specified in this section 
    are: ATE_IND.1-3, ATE_IND.1-4, ATE_IND.1-5, ATE_IND.1-6, and ATE_IND.1-7.</p><h2 class="indexable" data-level="1" id="aa-bpp-gpos">2.1

			(e.g through receipt of required connection parameters from a VPN gateway), the evaluator shall ensure
			that the operational guidance contains any appropriate information for ensuring that this configuration
			can be properly applied.<br/><br/>
			Note in this case that the implementation of the IPsec protocol must be enforced entirely within the TOE
			boundary; i.e. it is not permissible for a software application TOE to be a graphical front-end for IPsec
			functionality implemented totally or in part by the underlying OS platform. The behavior referenced here

		</div><div class="eacategory">Tests</div><div class="ea">
			As a prerequisite for performing the Test EAs for the individual FCS_IPSEC_EXT.1 elements below, the

			The evaluator shall minimally create a test environment equivalent to the test environment illustrated
			below. It is expected that the traffic generator is used to construct network packets and will provide the
			evaluator with the ability manipulate fields in the ICMP, IPv4, IPv6, UDP, and TCP packet headers. The
			evaluator shall provide justification for any differences in the test environment.<br/><br/>

              <div class="eacategory">TSS</div><div class="ea">The evaluator shall examine the TSS and determine that it describes how the IPsec capabilities are
				implemented.<br/><br/>

                If the TOE is a standalone software application, the evaluator shall ensure that the TSS asserts that all
				IPsec functionality is implemented by the TSF. The evaluator shall also ensure that the TSS identifies what
				platform functionality the TSF relies upon to support its IPsec implementation, if any (e.g. does it invoke
				cryptographic primitive functions from the platform’s cryptographic library, enforcement of packet
				routing decisions by low-level network drivers).<br/><br/>

                If the TOE is part of a general-purpose desktop or mobile OS, the evaluator shall ensure
				that the TSS describes at a high level the architectural relationship between the VPN client portion of the
				TOE and the rest of the TOE (e.g. is the VPN client an integrated part of the OS or is it a standalone
				executable that is bundled into the OS package). If the SPD is implemented by the underlying platform in
				this case, then the TSS describes how the client interacts with the platform to establish and populate the
				SPD, including the identification of the platform's interfaces that are used by the client.<br/><br/>
		    
				In all cases, the evaluator shall also ensure that the TSS describes how the client interacts with the network
				stack of the platforms on which it can run (e.g., does the client insert itself within the stack via kernel
				mods, does the client simply invoke APIs to gain access to network services).<br/><br/>
		      
				The evaluator shall ensure that the TSS describes how the SPD is implemented and the rules for processing
				both inbound and outbound packets in terms of the IPsec policy. The TSS describes the rules that are
				available and the resulting actions available after matching a rule. The TSS describes how the available
				rules and actions form the SPD using terms defined in RFC 4301 such as BYPASS (e.g., no encryption),
				DISCARD (e.g., drop the packet), and PROTECT (e.g., encrypt the packet) actions defined in RFC 4301.
			  
				As noted in section 4.4.1 of RFC 4301, the processing of entries in the SPD is non-trivial and the evaluator
				shall determine that the description in the TSS is sufficient to determine which rules will be applied given
				the rule structure implemented by the TOE. For example, if the TOE allows specification of ranges,
				conditional rules, etc., the evaluator shall determine that the description of rule processing (for both
				inbound and outbound packets) is sufficient to determine the action that will be applied, especially in the
				case where two different rules may apply. This description shall cover both the initial packets (that is, no
				SA is established on the interface or for that particular packet) as well as packets that are part of an
				established SA.<br/><br/>

              <div class="eacategory">Guidance</div><div class="ea">
                The evaluator shall examine the operational guidance to verify it describes how the SPD is created and
		configured. If there is an administrative interface to the client, then the guidance describes how the
		administrator specifies rules for processing a packet. The description includes all three cases - a rule that
		ensures packets are encrypted/decrypted, dropped, and allowing a packet to flow in plaintext. The
		evaluator shall determine that the description in the operational guidance is consistent with the
		description in the TSS, and that the level of detail in the operational guidance is sufficient to allow the
		administrator to set up the SPD in an unambiguous fashion. This includes a discussion of how ordering of
		rules impacts the processing of an IP packet.<br/><br/>

                If the client is configured by an external application, such as the VPN gateway, then the operational
		guidance should indicate this and provide a description of how the client is configured by the external
		application. The description should contain information as to how the SPD is established and set up in an
		unambiguous fashion. The description should also include what is configurable via the external
		application, how ordering of entries may be expressed, as well as the impacts that ordering of entries may
		have on the packet processing.<br/><br/>

               	In either case, the evaluator ensures the description provided In the TSS is consistent with the capabilities
		and description provided in the operational guidance.<br/><br/>

                Depending on the implementation, the evaluator may be required to use a VPN gateway or some form of
		application to configure the client. For Test 2, the evaluator is required to choose an application that
		allows for the configuration of the full set of capabilities of the VPN client (in conjunction with the
		platform). For example, if the client provides a robust interface that allows for specification of wildcards,
		subnets, etc., it is unacceptable for the evaluator to choose a VPN Gateway that only allows for specifying
		a single fully qualified IP addresses in the rule.<br/><br/>

                The evaluator shall perform the following tests:
                <ul>
                  <li><b>Test 1: </b> The evaluator shall configure an SPD on the client that is capable of the following: dropping a
			packet, encrypting a packet, and allowing a packet to flow in plaintext. The selectors used in the
			construction of the rule shall be different such that the evaluator can generate a packet and send packets
			to the client with the appropriate fields (fields that are used by the rule - e.g., the IP addresses, TCP/UDP
			ports) in the packet header. The evaluator performs both positive and negative test cases for each type
			of rule. The evaluator observes via the audit trail, and packet captures that the TOE exhibited the expected
			behavior: appropriate packets were dropped, allowed through without modification, was encrypted by
			the IPsec implementation.</li>
                  <li><b>Test 2: </b>The evaluator shall devise several tests that cover a variety of scenarios for packet processing.
			These scenarios must exercise the range of possibilities for SPD entries and processing modes as outlined

			conflicting entries, inbound and outbound packets, and packets that establish SAs as well as packets that
			belong to established SAs. The evaluator shall verify, via the audit trail and packet captures, for each
			scenario that the expected behavior is exhibited, and is consistent with both the TSS and the operational
			guidance.

		rekeying the SA when necessary. If the two ends have different lifetime policies, the end with the shorter

		audit records in accordance with the EAs associated with the functional requirements in the VPN Client 
		PP-Module. Additionally, the evaluator shall test that each administrative action applicable in the context
		of the VPN Client PP-Module is auditable. When verifying the test results, the evaluator shall ensure the
		audit records generated during testing match the format specified in the administrative guide, and that
		the fields in each audit record have the proper entries.
		<br/><br/>

              Note that the testing here can be accomplished in conjunction with the testing of the security mechanisms
		directly. For example, testing performed to ensure that the administrative guidance provided is correct
		verifies that AGD_OPE.1 is satisfied and should address the invocation of the administrative actions that
		are needed to verify the audit records are generated as expected.

	base-PP to which it must claim conformance.
	It is important to note that a TOE that is evaluated against the PP-Module is
	inherently evaluated against the Base-PP as well.

	The Base-PP includes a number of Evaluation Activities associated with both SFRs and SARs.
	Additionally, the PP-Module includes a number of SFR-based Evaluation Activities 
	that similarly refine the SARs of the Base-PPs.
	The evaluation laboratory will evaluate the TOE against the chosen Base-PP
      
    and supplement that evaluation with the necessary SFRs that are taken from the PP-Module.
