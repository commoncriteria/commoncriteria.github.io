    PP-Module for Virtual Private Network (VPN) Clients is
    to describe the security functionality of 
      Virtual Private Network (VPN) Clients products in terms of 
    [CC] and to define functional and assurance requirements for them.

    
    The PP-Module is intended for use with the following Base-PPs:
        <ul><li><a href="">
    Protection Profile for , Version </a></li><li><a href="">
    Protection Profile for , Version </a></li><li><a href="">
    Protection Profile for , Version </a></li><li><a href="">
    Protection Profile for Mobile Device Management, Version </a></li></ul><br/>
    This SD is mandatory for evaluations of TOEs that claim conformance to a PP-Configuration that includes the PP-Module for :
    <ul><li>Virtual Private Network (VPN) Clients, Version 2.2</li></ul>
    As such it defines Evaluation Activities for the functionality described in the PP-Module as well as any impacts to the Evaluation Activites to the Base-PP(s) it modifies.
    </p><p> 
Although Evaluation Activities are defined mainly for the evaluators to follow, in general they also help developers to prepare for evaluation by identifying specific requirements for their TOE.
    The specific requirements in Evaluation Activities may in some cases clarify the meaning of Security
    Functional Requirements (SFR), and may identify particular requirements for the content of Security
    Targets (ST) (especially the TOE Summary Specification), user guidance documentation, and possibly
    supplementary information (e.g. for entropy analysis or cryptographic key management architecture).</p><h2 id="structure" class="indexable" data-level="1">1.2 Structure of the Document</h2><p>Evaluation Activities can be defined for both SFRs and Security Assurance Requirements (SAR),
    which are themselves defined in separate sections of the SD.</p><p>If any Evaluation Activity cannot be successfully completed in an evaluation, then
    the overall verdict for the evaluation is a 'fail'.
    In rare cases there may be acceptable reasons why an Evaluation Activity
    may be modified or deemed not applicable for a particular TOE, 
    but this must be approved by the Certification Body for the evaluation.</p><p>In general, if all Evaluation Activities (for both SFRs and SARs) are successfully
    completed in an evaluation then it would be expected that the overall verdict for 
    the evaluation is a ‘pass’.
    To reach a ‘fail’ verdict when the Evaluation Activities have been successfully 
    completed would require a specific justification from the evaluator as to why the 
    Evaluation Activities were not sufficient for that TOE.
    </p><p>Similarly, at the more granular level of assurance components, if the Evaluation 
    Activities for an assurance component and all of its related SFR Evaluation 
    Activities are successfully completed in an evaluation then it would be expected 
    that the verdict for the assurance component is a ‘pass’.
    To reach a ‘fail’ verdict for the assurance component when these Evaluation 
    Activities have been successfully completed would require a specific justification 
    from the evaluator as to why the Evaluation Activities were not sufficient for that TOE.

            This SFR defines a trusted channel for IPsec, which is added
              functionality that does not prevent the existing OS functions from
              being performed.
            
            
              
                The 
                  VPN client
                  OS
                
                shall use IPsec to provide a trusted
                communication channel between itself and 
                
                  a remote VPN gateway
                  a remote VPN client
                  a remote IPsec-capable network device
                 that is logically
                distinct from other communication channels and provides assured identification
                of its end points and protection of the channel data from disclosure and
                detection of modification of the channel data.
              
            
            
              
                The 
                
                  VPN client
                  OS
                 shall permit [the TSF] to initiate communication with the trusted channel.

                  OS
                 shall initiate communication via the trusted
                channel [for all traffic traversing that connection].
              
              
                The intent of the above requirement is to demonstrate that IPsec can be used to
                establish remote communications in transport and/or tunnel mode.
                The requirement implies that not only are communications protected when they
                are initially established, but also on resumption after an outage. It may be the
                case that some part of the TOE setup involves manually setting up tunnels to
                protect other communication, and if after an outage the TOE attempts to reestablish 
                the communication automatically with (the necessary) manual
                intervention, there may be a window created where an attacker might be able to
                gain critical information or compromise a connection.
              
              
                The evaluator shall examine the TSS to determine that it describes the details of the TOE connecting to a
			VPN gateway and/or VPN client and/or IPsec-capable network device in terms of the cryptographic
			protocols specified in the requirement, along with TOE-specific options or procedures that might not be
			reflected in the specification. The evaluator shall also confirm that all protocols listed in the TSS are
			specified and included in the requirements in the ST.
                
                The evaluator shall confirm that the operational guidance contains instructions for establishing the
			connection to a VPN gateway and/or VPN client and/or IPsec-capable network device, and that it contains
			recovery instructions should a connection be unintentionally broken.
                
                
                  The evaluator shall perform the following tests:
                  
                    The evaluators shall ensure that the TOE is able to initiate communications with a VPN gateway
			and/or VPN client and/or IPsec-capable network device using the protocols specified in the requirement,
			setting up the connections as described in the operational guidance and ensuring that communication is
			successful.
                    The evaluator shall ensure, for each communication channel with an IPsec peer, the channel data
			is not sent in plaintext.
                    
                    The evaluator shall ensure, for each communication channel with an IPsec peer, modification of
			the channel data is detected by the TOE.
                    The evaluators shall physically interrupt the connection from the TOE to the IPsec peer. The
			evaluators shall ensure that subsequent communications are appropriately protected, at a minimum in
			the case of any attempts to automatically resume the connection or connect to a new access point.

            This PP-Module adds IPsec as a new trusted protocol where x.509
              certificate authentication is used.
            
              The TSF shall use X.509v3 certificates as defined by RFC 5280 to support
                authentication for IPsec and 
                
                  TLS
                  HTTPS
                  DTLS
                  no other protocols
                , and 
                
                  code signing for system software updates
                  code signing for mobile applications
                  code signing for integrity verification
                  other uses
                  no additional uses
                .
              
            
            
              When the TSF cannot establish a connection to determine the validity of a
                certificate, the TSF shall 
                
                  allow the administrator to choose whether to accept the certificate in these cases
                  allow the user to choose whether to accept the certificate in these cases
                  accept the certificate
                  not accept the certificate
                .
              
              
                This SFR is identical to what is defined in the MDF PP except that support for
                IPsec is mandated. Since the original SFR did not explicitly require at least one of
                TLS, HTTPS, or DTLS to be selected, “no other protocols” has also been added as
                a selection in the event that IPsec is the only protocol for which the TOE uses
                X.509v3 certificates for authentication.

            This PP-Module adds IPsec as a new protocol that is used to
              implement trusted channels.
            
              The TSF shall use 802.11-2012, 802.1X, EAP-TLS, IPsec, and

                and another trusted IT product that is logically distinct from other
                communication channels, provides assured identification of its end points,
                protects channel data from disclosure, and detects modification of the channel
                data.
                
            
            
              The TSF shall permit the TSF to initiate communication via the trusted channel.
              
            
            
              
                The TSF shall initiate communication via the trusted channel for wireless access
                point connections, administrative communication, configured enterprise
                connections, and

                This SFR is identical to what is defined in the Base-PP except that support for
                IPsec is mandated. Additionally, since the Base-PP requires ‘at least one of’ the
                selected protocols which previously included IPsec, ‘no other protocols’ is now
                available as an option in the selection.

                services are required in some capacity in order to support VPN
                functionality, the ST author loses the choice of stating that the
                application does not have any key generation functionality.
                Additionally, this behavior is selection-based in the App PP but is made
                mandatory since it is required for VPN client functionality.
              
                The application shall

                  This selection differs from its definition in the App PP by
                  removing the selection for “generate no asymmetric cryptographic keys” for this PP-Module because a VPN Client
                  TOE will either perform its own key generation or interface with the underlying platform to provide this 
                  service, either of which causes FCS_CKM.1(1) to be claimed.
                
                 
                  This SFR is evaluated in conjunction with FCS_CKM.1(1) in the App PP.

                unmodified.
              
                The application shall perform encryption/decryption in accordance with

                  This SFR is selection-based in the Base-PP and remains selection-based here because
                  this PP-Module allows for the possibility that the TSF relies on platform-provided
                  cryptographic algorithm services for its own implementation of IPsec. However, if
                  the TSF does claim this SFR to support IPsec, the ST author must select at minimum
                  both AES-CBC and AES-GCM with both 128-bit and 256-bit key sizes for consistency
                  with the relevant IPsec claims (FCS_IPSEC_EXT.1.4 requires both 128-bit and 256-bit
                  AES-GCM and FCS_IPSEC_EXT.1.6 requires both 128-bit and 256-bit AES-CBC).
                
                
			
				If the TSF implements AES cryptography in support of both credential encryption (per FCS_STO_EXT.1)
				and IPsec, the evaluator shall examine the TSS to ensure that it clearly identifies the modes and key sizes

              This PP-Module adds IPsec as a new trusted protocol where x.509
                certificate authentication is used.
              
                The application shall use X.509v3 certificates as defined by RFC 5280 to support
                  authentication for IPsec and [no other protocols].
                
              
              
                When the application cannot establish a connection to determine the validity of a
                  certificate, the TSF shall 
                  
                    allow the administrator to choose whether to accept the certificate in these cases
                    accept the certificate
                    not accept the certificate
                  .
                
                
                  This SFR is identical to what is defined in the App PP except that mandatory
                  support for IPsec is added. Additionally, because this SFR is selection-based in
                  the App PP but is mandatory for VPN client usage, the ‘no other protocols’
                  selection item has been added since it is expected that IPsec is the TOE’s only use
                  of certificates.

            This PP-Module adds a requirement for key storage, which is new
              functionality when compared to the Base-PP but does not interfere
              with its existing security functions.
            requires the TSF to securely store key data when not in use.
            No specific management functions are identified.
            There are no auditable events foreseen.
            No dependencies
            
              The 
                
                  TOE
                  TOE platform
                 shall store persistent secrets and private keys
                when not in use in platform-provided key storage.
              
              
                This requirement ensures that persistent secrets and private keys are stored
                securely when not in use. This differs from FCS_STO_EXT.1 in the Base-PP, which
                only applies to secure storage of administrative credentials. If some secrets/keys
                are manipulated by the TOE and others are manipulated by the platform, then
                both of the selections can be specified by the ST author.
              
               
                Regardless of whether this requirement is met by the TOE or the TOE platform, the evaluator will check
			the TSS to ensure that it lists each persistent secret (credential, secret key) and private key needed to
			meet the requirements in the ST. For each of these items, the evaluator will confirm that the TSS lists for
			what purpose it is used, and how it is stored. The evaluator then performs the following actions: 

                  	Persistent secrets and private keys manipulated by the platform:

               	 	For each platform listed in the ST, the evaluator shall examine the ST of the platform to ensure that the
			persistent secrets and private keys listed as being stored by the platform in the VPN client ST are identified
			as being protected in that platform's ST

                  	Persistent secrets and private keys manipulated by the TOE:

                  	The evaluator reviews the TSS for to determine that it makes a case that, for each item listed as being
			manipulated by the TOE, it is not written unencrypted to persistent memory, and that the item is stored
			by the platform.
                
                There are no AGD EAs for this requirement.
                There are no test EAs for this requirement.
              
            
            
          

          
          
            This PP-Module adds a requirement for key destruction, which is new
              functionality when compared to the Base-PP but does not interfere
              with its existing security functions.
            requires the TSF to destroy key data when no longer required.
            No specific management functions are identified.
            There are no auditable events foreseen.
            No dependencies
            
              The 
                
                  TOE
                  TOE platform
                 
                shall zeroize all plaintext secret and private cryptographic keys and CSPs when no longer required.
              
              
                Any security related information (such as keys, authentication data, and
                passwords) must be zeroized when no longer in use to prevent the disclosure or
                modification of security critical data.

                The zeroization indicated above applies to each intermediate storage area for
                plaintext key/CSP (i.e., any storage, such as memory buffers, that is included in
                the path of such data) upon the transfer of the key/CSP to another location.

                In practice, the TOE will not implement all of the functionality associated with
                the requirement, since if it performs zeroization at all it will be by invoking
                platform interfaces to perform the storage location clear/overwrite function. The
                ST author should select "TOE" when, for at least one of the keys needed to meet
                the requirements of this PP, the TOE manipulates (reads, writes) the data
                identified in the requirement and thus needs to ensure that those data are
                cleared. In these cases, it is sufficient for the TOE to invoke the correct
                underlying functions of the host to perform the zeroization--it does not imply
                that the TOE has to include a kernel-mode memory driver to ensure the data are
                zeroized.

                In the likely event that some of the data are manipulated by the TOE and other
                data are manipulated entirely by the platform, the ST author must select both
                options.
              
               
                The evaluator shall ensure that all plaintext secret and private cryptographic keys and CSPs (whether
			manipulated by the TOE or exclusively by the platform) are identified in the VPN Client ST's TSS, and that
			they are accounted for by the EAs in this section. 

                  	Requirement met by the platform:

                  	The evaluator shall check to ensure the TSS describes each of the secret keys (keys used for
                  	symmetric encryption), private keys, and CSPs used to generate key that are not otherwise covered
                  	by the FCS_CKM_EXT.4 requirement levied on the TOE.
                  	For each platform listed in the ST, the evaluator shall examine the TSS of the ST of the platform to
                  	ensure that each of the secret keys, private keys, and CSPs used to generate key listed above are
                  	covered. 

                  	Requirement met by the TOE:

                  	The evaluator shall check to ensure the TSS describes when each of the plaintext keys are cleared (e.g.,
			system power off, disconnection of an IPsec connection, when no longer needed by the VPN channel per
			the protocol); and the type of clearing procedure that is performed (cryptographic erase, overwrite with
			zeros, overwrite three or more times by a different alternating pattern, overwrite with random pattern,
			or block erase). If different types of memory are used to store the materials to be protected, the evaluator
			shall check to ensure that the TSS describes the clearing procedure in terms of the memory in which the
			data are stored (for example, "secret keys stored on flash are cleared by overwriting once with zeros,
			while secret keys stored on the internal persistent storage device are cleared by overwriting three times
			with a random pattern that is changed before each write").
		
                There are no AGD EAs for this requirement.
                
			For each key clearing situation described in the TSS, the evaluator shall repeat the following test.
                	
                  		The evaluator shall utilize appropriate combinations of specialized operational environment and
					development tools (debuggers, simulators, etc.) for the TOE and instrumented TOE builds to test that keys
					are cleared correctly, including all intermediate copies of the key that may have been created internally
					by the TOE during normal cryptographic processing with that key. 
                    			Cryptographic TOE implementations in software shall be loaded and exercised under a debugger to
					perform such tests. The evaluator shall perform the following test for each key subject to clearing,
					including intermediate copies of keys that are persisted encrypted by the TOE:
					
						Load the instrumented TOE build in a debugger.
					        Record the value of the key in the TOE subject to clearing.
                    				Cause the TOE to perform a normal cryptographic processing with the key from #1.
                    				Cause the TOE to clear the key.
				                Cause the TOE to stop the execution but not exit.
                    				Cause the TOE to dump the entire memory footprint of the TOE into a binary file.
                    				Search the content of the binary file created in #4 for instances of the known key value from
  					                  #1.
					
		                    	The test succeeds if no copies of the key from #1 are found in step #7 above and fails otherwise.
 		                   	The evaluator shall perform this test on all keys, including those persisted in encrypted form, to ensure
					intermediate copies are cleared.

			If the TOE boundary includes a general-purpose operating system or mobile device, the evaluator shall

		<div class="eacategory">Guidance</div>
			In addition to the Operational Guidance EAs for the individual FCS_IPSEC_EXT.1 elements below, the

			If the configuration of the IPsec behavior is from an environmental source, most notably a VPN gateway
			(e.g through receipt of required connection parameters from a VPN gateway), the evaluator shall ensure
			that the operational guidance contains any appropriate information for ensuring that this configuration

			Note in this case that the implementation of the IPsec protocol must be enforced entirely within the TOE
			boundary; i.e. it is not permissible for a software application TOE to be a graphical front-end for IPsec
			functionality implemented totally or in part by the underlying OS platform. The behavior referenced here
			is for the possibility that the configuration of the IPsec connection is initiated from outside the TOE, which
			is permissible so long as the TSF is solely responsible for enforcing the configured behavior. However, it is

               In particular, the evaluator shall ensure that the operational guidance is clear in relation to the contents
		for failed cryptographic events. In the Auditable Events table of the VPN Client PP-Module, information

		endpoint of the connection for cryptographic failures relating to communications with other IT systems.<p></p>

               The evaluator shall also make a determination of the administrative actions that are relevant in the

		context of the VPN Client PP-Module because the functionality is not specified in an SFR. This functionality
		may have administrative aspects that are described in the operational guidance. Since such administrative
		actions will not be performed in an evaluated configuration of the TOE, the evaluator shall examine the
		operational guidance and make a determination of which administrative commands, including
		subcommands, scripts, and configuration files, are related to the configuration (including enabling or
		disabling) of the mechanisms implemented in the TOE that are necessary to enforce the requirements
		specified in the VPN Client PP-Module, which thus form the set of “all administrative actions”. The
		evaluator may perform this activity as part of the activities associated with ensuring the AGD_OPE
		guidance satisfies the requirements.<p></p>
		    
		For each required auditable event, the evaluator shall examine the operational guidance to determine
		that it is clear to the reader where each event is generated (e.g. the TSF may generate its own audit logs
		in one location while the platform-provided auditable events are generated elsewhere).
	<div class="eacategory">Tests</div>The evaluator shall test the TOE’s ability to correctly generate audit records by having the TOE generate

		the fields in each audit record have the proper entries.
		<p></p>

              Note that the testing here can be accomplished in conjunction with the testing of the security mechanisms
		directly. For example, testing performed to ensure that the administrative guidance provided is correct
