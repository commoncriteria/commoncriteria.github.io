    to describe the security functionality of 
      Virtual Private Network (VPN) Clients products in terms of 
    [CC] and to define functional and assurance requirements for them.
    The PP-Module is intended for use with the
    
	following Base-PPs:
	<ul><li><a href=''>, Version </a></li><li><a href=''>, Version </a></li><li><a href=''>, Version </a></li><li><a href=''>, Version </a></li></ul>.</p><p>This SD is mandatory for evaluations of TOEs that claim conformance to a PP-Configuration that includes the PP-Module for Virtual Private Network (VPN) Clients, Version 2.4-Draft.
    Although Evaluation Activities are defined mainly for the evaluators to follow, in general they also help Developers to prepare for evaluation by identifying specific requirements for their TOE.
    The specific requirements in Evaluation Activities may in some cases clarify the meaning of Security
    Functional Requirements (SFR), and may identify particular requirements for the content of Security
    Targets (ST) (especially the TOE Summary Specification), user guidance documentation, and possibly
    supplementary information (e.g. for entropy analysis or cryptographic key management architecture).</p><h2 id='structure' class='indexable' data-level='1'>1.2 Structure of the Document</h2><p>Evaluation Activities can be defined for both SFRs and Security Assurance Requirements (SAR),
    which are themselves defined in separate sections of the SD.</p><p>If any Evaluation Activity cannot be successfully completed in an evaluation then
    the overall verdict for the evaluation is a 'fail'.
    In rare cases there may be acceptable reasons why an Evaluation Activity
    may be modified or deemed not applicable for a particular TOE, 
    but this must be approved by the Certification Body for the evaluation.</p><p>In general, if all Evaluation Activities (for both SFRs and SARs) are successfully
    completed in an evaluation then it would be expected that the overall verdict for 
    the evaluation is a ‘pass’.
    To reach a ‘fail’ verdict when the Evaluation Activities have been successfully 
    completed would require a specific justification from the evaluator as to why the 
    Evaluation Activities were not sufficient for that TOE.
    </p><p>Similarly, at the more granular level of Assurance Components, if the Evaluation 
    Activities for an Assurance Component and all of its related SFR Evaluation 
    Activities are successfully completed in an evaluation then it would be expected 
    that the verdict for the Assurance Component is a ‘pass’.
    To reach a ‘fail’ verdict for the Assurance Component when these Evaluation 
    Activities have been successfully completed would require a specific justification 
    from the evaluator as to why the Evaluation Activities were not sufficient for that TOE.

    to address technology specific aspects covering specific SARs (e.g. ASE_TSS.1, 
    ADV_FSP.1, AGD_OPE.1, and ATE_IND.1) – this is in addition to the CEM work units 
    that are performed in <a href='#sar_aas' class='dynref'> 6 Evaluation Activities for SARs</a>.</p><p>Regarding design descriptions (designated by the subsections labelled TSS, as 
    well as any required supplementary material that may be treated as proprietary), 
    the evaluator must ensure there is specific information that satisfies the EA. 
    For findings regarding the TSS section, the evaluator’s verdicts will be 
    associated with the CEM work unit ASE_TSS.1-1.
    Evaluator verdicts associated with the supplementary evidence will also be 
    associated with ASE_TSS.1-1, 
    since the requirement to provide such evidence is specified in ASE in the cPP.</p><p>For ensuring the guidance documentation provides sufficient information for 
    the administrators/users as it pertains to SFRs, the evaluator’s verdicts will 
    be associated with CEM work units ADV_FSP.1-7, AGD_OPE.1-4, and AGD_OPE.1-5.</p><p>Finally, the subsection labelled Tests is where the authors have determined 
    that testing of the product in the context of the associated SFR is necessary.
    While the evaluator is expected to develop tests, there may be instances where 
    it is more practical for the developer to construct tests, or where the 
    developer may have existing tests. 
    Therefore, it is acceptable for the evaluator to witness developer-generated 
    tests in lieu of executing the tests. 
    In this case, the evaluator must ensure the developer’s tests are executing both 
    in the manner declared by the developer and as mandated by the EA. 
    The CEM work units that are associated with the EAs specified in this section 
    are: ATE_IND.1-3, ATE_IND.1-4, ATE_IND.1-5, ATE_IND.1-6, and ATE_IND.1-7.</p><h2 class='indexable' data-level='1' id='aa-$'>2.1  Protection Profile

        <div class='comp' id='FAU-GEN-1-VPN'><h4>FAU-GEN-1-VPN Audit Data Generation</h4><div class='eacategory'>TSS</div>The evaluator shall examine the TSS to determine that it describes the auditable events and the
		component that is responsible for each type of auditable event.<p></p><div class='eacategory'>Guidance</div>The evaluator shall check the operational guidance and ensure that it lists all of the auditable events and
			provides a format for audit records. Each audit record format type must be covered, along with a brief
			description of each field. The evaluator shall check to make sure that every audit event type mandated by
			the VPN Client PP-Module is described and that the description of the fields contains the information
			required in FAU_GEN.1.2/VPN, and the additional information specified in the Auditable Events table of
			the VPN Client PP-PP-Module.
			<p></p>

               In particular, the evaluator shall ensure that the operational guidance is clear in relation to the contents
		for failed cryptographic events. In the Auditable Events table of the VPN Client PP-Module, information
		detailing the cryptographic mode of operation and a name or identifier for the object being encrypted is
		required. The evaluator shall ensure that name or identifier is sufficient to allow an administrator
		reviewing the audit log to determine the context of the cryptographic operation (for example, performed
		during a key negotiation exchange, performed when encrypting data for transit) as well as the non-TOE
		endpoint of the connection for cryptographic failures relating to communications with other IT systems.<p></p>

               The evaluator shall also make a determination of the administrative actions that are relevant in the
		context of the VPN Client PP-Module. The TOE may contain functionality that is not evaluated in the
		context of the VPN Client PP-Module because the functionality is not specified in an SFR. This functionality
		may have administrative aspects that are described in the operational guidance. Since such administrative
		actions will not be performed in an evaluated configuration of the TOE, the evaluator shall examine the
		operational guidance and make a determination of which administrative commands, including
		subcommands, scripts, and configuration files, are related to the configuration (including enabling or
		disabling) of the mechanisms implemented in the TOE that are necessary to enforce the requirements
		specified in the VPN Client PP-Module, which thus form the set of “all administrative actions”. The
		evaluator may perform this activity as part of the activities associated with ensuring the AGD_OPE
		guidance satisfies the requirements.<p></p>
		    
		For each required auditable event, the evaluator shall examine the operational guidance to determine
		that it is clear to the reader where each event is generated (e.g. the TSF may generate its own audit logs
		in one location while the platform-provided auditable events are generated elsewhere).
	<div class='eacategory'>Tests</div>The evaluator shall test the TOE’s ability to correctly generate audit records by having the TOE generate
		audit records in accordance with the EAs associated with the functional requirements in the VPN Client 
		PP-Module. Additionally, the evaluator shall test that each administrative action applicable in the context
		of the VPN Client PP-Module is auditable. When verifying the test results, the evaluator shall ensure the
		audit records generated during testing match the format specified in the administrative guide, and that
		the fields in each audit record have the proper entries.
		<p></p>

              Note that the testing here can be accomplished in conjunction with the testing of the security mechanisms
		directly. For example, testing performed to ensure that the administrative guidance provided is correct
		verifies that AGD_OPE.1 is satisfied and should address the invocation of the administrative actions that
		are needed to verify the audit records are generated as expected.

		types, as well as describes all attributes that are to be selectable in accordance with the requirement, to
		include those attributes listed in the assignment. The administrative guidance shall also contain
		instructions on how to set the pre-selection, or how the VPN gateway will configure the client, as well as
		explain the syntax (if present) for multi-value pre-selection. The administrative guidance shall also identify
		those audit records that are always recorded, regardless of the selection criteria currently being enforced.<p></p><div class='eacategory'>Tests</div>The evaluator shall perform the following tests:
              <ul>
                <li><b>Test 1: </b>For each attribute listed in the requirement, the evaluator shall devise a test to show that selecting
			the attribute causes only audit events with that attribute (or those that are always recorded, as identified
			in the administrative guidance) to be recorded.
                </li>
                <li><b>Test 2: </b>[conditional] If the TSF supports specification of more complex audit pre-selection criteria (e.g.,
			multiple attributes, logical expressions using attributes) then the evaluator shall devise tests showing that

			justifying the set of tests as representative and sufficient to exercise the capability.

		baseband protocol in which only the traffic identified by the ST author is necessary for establishing the
		VPN connection (IKE traffic and perhaps HTTPS or DNS traffic) is not encapsulated by the VPN protocol 
		(IPsec). The ST author shall also identify in the TSS section any differences in the routing of IP traffic when

                <li>The description above indicates that if a VPN client is enabled, all configurations route all IP traffic
			(other than IP traffic required to establish the VPN connection) through the VPN client.</li>

                The evaluator shall perform the following test:<p></p>
                Step 1 - The evaluator shall use the platform to enable a network connection without using IPsec. The
		evaluator shall use a packet sniffing tool between the platform and an Internet-connected network. The
		evaluator shall turn on the sniffing tool and perform actions with the device such as navigating to
		websites, using provided applications, accessing other Internet resources (Use Case 1), accessing another
		VPN client (Use Case 2), or accessing an IPsec-capable network device (Use Case 3). The evaluator shall
		verify that the sniffing tool captures the traffic generated by these actions, turn off the sniffing tool, and
		save the session data. <p></p>
                Step 2 - The evaluator shall configure an IPsec VPN client that supports the routing specified in this
		requirement, and if necessary, configure the device to perform the routing specified as described in the
		AGD guidance. The evaluator shall turn on the sniffing tool, establish the VPN connection, and perform
		the same actions with the device as performed in the first step. The evaluator shall verify that the sniffing
		tool captures traffic generated by these actions, turn off the sniffing tool, and save the session data.<p></p>
                Step 3 - The evaluator shall examine the traffic from both step one and step two to verify that all IP traffic,
		aside from and after traffic necessary for establishing the VPN (such as IKE, DNS, and possibly HTTPS), is
		encapsulated by IPsec.<p></p>
                Step 4 - The evaluator shall attempt to send packets to the TOE outside the VPN connection and shall
		verify that the TOE discards them.

      <h1 id='sar_aas' class='indexable' data-level='0'>6 Evaluation Activities for SARs</h1><p>The PP-Module does not define any SARs beyond those defined within the
    
	base-PP to which it must claim conformance.
	It is important to note that a TOE that is evaluated against the PP-Module is
	inherently evaluated against the Base-PP as well.

	The Base-PP includes a number of Evaluation Activities associated with both SFRs and SARs.
	Additionally, the PP-Module includes a number of SFR-based Evaluation Activities 
	that similarly refine the SARs of the Base-PPs.
	The evaluation laboratory will evaluate the TOE against the chosen Base-PP
      
    and supplement that evaluation with the necessary SFRs that are taken from the PP-Module.
