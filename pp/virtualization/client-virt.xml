  <section id="Introduction" title="Introduction">

    <!-- 1.1 Overview -->
    <section id="overview" title="Overview">
      The scope of this PP-Module is to define the security functionality of a Client Virtualization 
	    product in terms of [CC] and to define functional and assurance requirements for such 
	    products. This PP-Module is not complete in itself, but rather is intended for use with 
	    the following base PP:
	   
	      <htm:ul>
		      <htm:li>Protection Profile for Virtualization, Version 1.1.</htm:li>
	      </htm:ul>    
      
    	This base PP is valid because Client Virtualization is a specific type of Virtualization System and is expected to
      implement security functionality that is not common to all Virtualization Systems. One additional SFR
      has been defined in this PP-Module to define security functionality that is unique to this
      particular type of Virtualization System.

    <tech-terms>
        <term full="Administrator">Administrators perform management activities on the VS. These management functions 
          do not include administration of software running within Guest VMs, such as the Guest OS. Administrators need
          not be human as in the case of embedded or headless VMs. Administrators are often nothing more than software
          entities that operate within the VM.</term>
      <term full="Domain">A Domain or Information Domain is a policy construct that groups together execution 
          environments and networks by sensitivity of information and access control policy. For example, classification
          levels represent information domains. Within classification levels, there might be other domains representing
          communities of interest or coalitions. In the context of a VS, information domains are generally implemented
          as collections of VMs connected by virtual networks. The VS itself can be considered an Information Domain, 
          as can its Management Subsystem.</term>
      <term full="Guest Operating System (OS)">An operating system that runs within a Guest VM.</term>
      <term full="Guest VM">A Guest VM is a VM that contains a virtual environment for the execution of an independent

          server functionality in Guest VMs, such as a web server or desktop productivity applications.</term>

      <term full="Hypervisor">The Hypervisor is part of the VMM. It is the software executive of the physical platform
          of a VS. A Hypervisor’s primary function is to mediate access to all CPU and memory resources, but it is also
          responsible for either the direct management or the delegation of the management of all other hardware
          devices on the hardware platform.</term>
      <term full="Hypercall">An API function that allows VM-aware software running within a VM to invoke VMM functionality.</term>
      <term full="Management Subsystem">Components of the VS that allow VS Administrators to configure and manage the

          configuration, and allocation of physical resources.</term>

    <!-- 1.3 Compliant Targets of Evaluation -->
    <section id="targets" title="Compliant Targets of Evaluation">
            Client Virtualization, for the purposes of this PP-Module, refers to a Virtualization 
	    System that implements virtualized hardware components locally on an endpoint machine. 
	    Endpoints are typically client hardware such as desktop or laptop computers that a user 
	    interacts with directly, but may also include headless embedded systems without direct 
	    human interaction. A Virtualization System creates a virtualized hardware environment for 
	    each instance of a guest operating system (a virtual machine) permitting these environments
	    to execute concurrently while maintaining isolation and the appearance of exclusive control
	    over assigned computing resources. Client virtualization is generally used on endpoint 
	    systems, making use of the local machine's resources (memory, CPU, etc.) to provide 
	    isolated user environments.<htm:br/><htm:br/>
	    This document does not address virtualization on mobile devices (typically devices that use
	    a baseband processor or connect to a cellular network), nor does it address application 
	    virtualization or containers.
 
	    	<!-- 1.3.1 TOE Boundary -->
	    <section id="TOEboundary" title="TOE Boundary">
            	The TOE boundary is the same as that which is defined for a Virtualization System in
		    general. Refer to the base Virtualization PP for an outline of the TOE boundary.

	<!-- 1.4 Use Cases -->
    <section id="usecase" title="Use Cases">
            Requirements in this PP-Module are designed to address the security problem in the 
		following use cases.The description of these use cases provides examples for how
		the TOE and its Operational Environment could support the functionality required by this PP-Module.
            <usecases>
            <usecase title="Locally Managed Client" id="locally">
                <description>
                    A local administrator creates and runs one or more VMs locally. This client could 
			be stand-alone or connected to a network.
                </description>
            </usecase>
            <usecase title="Enterprise Managed Client" id="enterprise">
                <description>
                    An enterprise administrator for the VS centrally manages one or more client
			hypervisors, creating and configuring VMs which are then pushed to the clients. These VMs are then available for users on that client to run using the computing resources of that client. (Note that this is not Virtual Desktop Infrastructure where the hypervisors and the VMs run on remote servers. While both can be centrally managed and accessed from clients, for client virtualization, the VMs are local to the endpoint machine.) 
                </description>

            <usecase title="Headless Client" id="headless">

                    A VM is used by a program without direct human interaction.

<!--
            The use case(s) that are applicable to the TOE may influence the selections and a
		ssignments made for certain requirements in both this PP-Module and in the base PP.
		For example, a locally managed client (use case 1) may not necessarily provide remote
		administration which would exempt it from claiming the selection-based requirement 
		FTP_TRP.1 in the base PP.

	The TOE does not require any additional supplementary information to describe its entropy source(s)
	beyond the requirements outlined in the ‘Entropy Documentation and Assessment’ section of the Base
	Virtualization PP. As with other base PP requirements, the only additional requirement is that the
	entropy documentation also applies to the specific Client Virtualization capabilities of the TOE in
	addition to the functionality required by the base PP.
