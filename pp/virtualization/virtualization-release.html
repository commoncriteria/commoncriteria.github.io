        <h2 id="s-overview" class="indexable,h2" data-level="2">1.1 Overview</h2>
            The scope of this Protection Profile (PP) is to describe the security functionality of virtualization technologies in 
			terms of [CC] and to define security functional and assurance requirements for such products. This PP is not complete 
			in itself, but rather provides a set of requirements that are common to the PP-Modules for Server
			Virtualization and for Client Virtualization. These capabilities have been broken out into this generic ‘base’ PP due
			to the high degree of similarity between the two product types.<br/><br/>
            Due to the increasing prevalence of virtualization technology in enterprise computing environments and the shift
			to cloud computing, it is essential to ensure that this technology is implemented securely in order to mitigate
			the risk introduced by sharing multiple computers and their data across a single physical system.

		<h2 id="s-complianttargets" class="indexable,h2" data-level="2">1.3 Compliant Targets of Evaluation</h2>
				A Virtualization System (VS) is a software product that enables multiple independent computing systems to execute on the 
			same physical hardware platform without interference from one other. A VS creates a virtualized hardware environment
			(virtual machines or VMs) for each instance of an operating system permitting these environments to execute 
			concurrently while maintaining isolation and the appearance of exclusive control over assigned computing resources.
			For the purposes of this document, the VS consists of a Virtual Machine Manager (VMM), Virtual Machine (VM) 
			abstractions, a management subsystem, and other components.<br/><br/>
				A VMM is a collection of software components responsible for enabling VMs to function as expected by the software
			executing within them. Generally, the VMM consists of a Hypervisor, Service VMs, and other components of the VS,
			such as virtual devices, binary translation systems, and physical device drivers. It manages concurrent execution of 
			all VMs and virtualizes platform resources as needed.<br/><br/>
				The Hypervisor is the software executive of the physical platform of a VS. A hypervisor operates at 
			the highest CPU privilege level and manages access to all of the physical resources of the hardware platform. It
			exports a well-defined, protected interface for access to the resources it manages. A Hypervisor’s primary function is 
			to mediate access to all CPU and memory resources, but it is also responsible for either the direct management or the
			delegation of the management of all other hardware devices on the hardware platform. This document does not specify
			any Hypervisor-specific requirements, though many VMM requirements would naturally apply to a Hypervisor.<br/><br/>
				A Service VM is a VM whose purpose is to support the Hypervisor in providing the resources or services necessary to
			support Guest VMs. Service VMs may implement some portion of Hypervisor functionality, but also may contain important
			system functionality that is not necessary for Hypervisor operation. As with any VM, Service VMs necessarily execute
			without full Hypervisor privileges—only the privileges required to perform its designed functionality. Examples of 
			Service VMs include device driver VMs that manage access to physical devices, and name-service VMs that help establish 
			communication paths between VMs.<br/><br/>
				A Guest VM is a VM that contains a virtual environment for the execution of an independent computing system. Virtual 
			environments execute mission workloads and implement customer-specific client or server functionality in Guest VMs, 
			such as a web server or desktop productivity applications. A Helper VM is a VM that performs services on behalf of
			one or more Guest VMs, but does not qualify as a Service VM—and therefore is not part of the VMM. Helper VMs implement
			functions or services that are particular to the workloads of Guest VMs. For example, a VM that provides a virus 
			scanning service for a Guest VM would be considered a Helper VM. The line between Helper and Service VMs can easily
			be blurred. For instance, a VM that implements a cryptographic function—such as an in-line encryption VM—could be 
			identified as either a Service or Helper VM depending on the particular virtualization solution. If the cryptographic
			functions are necessary only for the privacy of Guest VM data in support of the Guest’s mission applications, it would
			be proper to classify the encryption VM as a Helper. But if the encryption VM is necessary for the VMM to isolate
			Guest VMs, it would be proper to classify the encryption VM as a Service 
			VM. For the purposes of this document, Helper VMs are subject to all requirements
			that apply to Guest VMs, unless specifically stated otherwise.<br/><br/>
			
			
			<h3 id="ss-toeboundary" class="indexable,h3" data-level="3">1.3.1 TOE Boundary</h3>
				Figure 1 shows a greatly simplified view of a generic Virtualization System and Platform. TOE components are displayed
				in Red. Non-TOE components are in Blue. The Platform is the hardware, firmware, and software onto which the VS is 
				installed. The VMM includes the Hypervisor, Service VMs, and VM containers, but not the software that runs inside
				Guest VMs or Helper VMs. The Management Subsystem is part of the TOE, but may or may not be part of the VMM. 
				<br/><br/>

				<div class="figure" id="figure-vsplatform"><img id="vsplatform" src="images/figure1.png" width="" height=""></img><br/><span class="ctr" data-myid="vsplatform" data-counter-type="ct-figure">Figure <span class="counter">1</span></span>:
      Virtualization System and Platform </div><br/><br/>
    
				For purposes of this Protection Profile, the Virtualization System is the TOE, subject to some caveats. The Platform
				onto which the VS is installed (which includes hardware, platform firmware, and Host Operating System) is not
				part of the TOE. Software installed with the VS on the Host OS specifically to support the VS
				or implement VS functionality is part of the TOE. General purpose software—such as device drivers for physical 
				devices and the Host OS itself—is not part of the TOE, regardless of whether it supports VS functionality or 
				runs inside a Service VM or control domain. Software that runs within Guest and Helper VMs is not part of the 
				TOE.<br/><br/>
					In general, for virtualization products that are installed onto “bare metal,” the entire set of installed components
				constitute the TOE, and the hardware constitutes the Platform. Also in general, for products that are hosted by or
				integrated into a commodity operating system, the components installed expressly for implementing and supporting
				virtualization are in the TOE, and the Platform comprises the hardware and Host OS.
			
		
			
			<h3 id="ss-platformreqs" class="indexable,h3" data-level="3">1.3.2 Requirements Met by the Platform</h3>
				Depending on the way the VS is installed, functions tested under this PP may be implemented by the TOE or by the
				Platform. There is no difference in the testing required whether the function is implemented by the TOE or by the
				Platform. In either case, the tests determine whether the function being tested provides a level of assurance 
				acceptable to meet the goals of this Profile with respect to a particular product and platform. The equivalency 
				guidelines are intended in part to address this TOE vs. Platform distinction, and to ensure that the assurance 
				level does not change between instances of equivalent products on equivalent platforms—and also, of course, to
				ensure that the appropriate testing is done when the distinction is significant.
			  --&gt;
		
			
			<h3 id="ss-scopecert" class="indexable,h3" data-level="3">1.3.3 Scope of Certification</h3>
				Successful evaluation of a Virtualization System against this profile does not constitute or imply successful 
				evaluation of any Host Operating System or Platform—no matter how tightly integrated with the VS. The Platform,
				including any Host OS, supports the VS through provision of services and resources. Specialized VS components 
				installed on or in a Host OS to support the VS may be considered part of the TOE. But general-purpose OS
				components and functions—whether or not they support the VS—are not part of the TOE, and thus
				are not evaluated under this PP.
			
		
			
		
			
			<h3 id="ss-equiv" class="indexable,h3" data-level="3">1.3.4 Product and Platform Equivalence</h3>
				The tests in this Protection Profile must be run on all product versions and Platforms with which the Vendor would 
				like to claim compliance—subject to this Profile’s equivalency guidelines (see <a href="#appendix-equiv" class="dynref"> </a>).
				
			
		

		
		<h2 id="s-usecases" class="indexable,h2" data-level="2">1.4 Use Cases</h2>
            This base PP does not define any use cases for virtualization technology. Client Virtualization and Server Virtualization
			products have different use cases and so these are defined in their respective PP-Modules.

                    It is a fundamental property of VMs that the domains encapsulated by different VMs remain separate unless 
					data sharing is permitted by policy. For this reason, all Virtualization Systems shall support a policy
					that prohibits information transfer between VMs.<br/><br/>
                        It shall be possible to configure VMs such that data cannot be moved between domains from VM to VM, or
					through virtual or physical network components under the control of the VS. When VMs are configured as
					such, it shall not be possible for data to leak between domains, neither by the express efforts of
					software or users of a VM, nor because of vulnerabilities or errors in the implementation of the VMM or
					other VS components.<br/><br/>
                        If it is possible for data to leak between domains when prohibited by policy, then an adversary on one domain 
					or network can obtain data from another domain. Such cross-domain data leakage can, for example, cause
					classified information, corporate proprietary information, or personally identifiable information to be
					made accessible to unauthorized entities.

                        It is common for attackers to target outdated versions of software containing known flaws. This means it is
			    extremely important to update VS software as soon as possible when updates are
			    available. But the source of the updates and the updates themselves must be trusted. If an attacker can
			    write their own update containing malicious code they can take control of the VS.

                        System integrity is a core security objective for Virtualization Systems. To achieve system integrity, the
			    integrity of each VMM component must be established and maintained. Malware running on the platform must
			    not be able to undetectably modify VS components while the system is running or at 
			    rest. Likewise, malicious code running within a virtual machine must not be able to modify Virtualization
			    System components.

                        If a Virtualization System is capable of simultaneously displaying VMs of different domains to the same user
			    at the same time, there is always the chance that the user will become confused and unintentionally leak
			    information between domains. This is especially likely if VMs belonging to different domains are 
			    indistinguishable. Malicious code may also attempt to interfere with the user’s ability to distinguish
			    between domains. The VS must take measures to minimize the likelihood of such confusion.

                        In some VS implementations, functions critical to the secuity of the TOE are by necessity performed by 
			    software not produced by the virtualization vendor. Such software may include physical device drivers, 
			    and even non-TOE entities such as Host Operating Systems. Since this software has the same or similar
			    privilege level as the VS, vulnerabilities can be exploited by an adversary to compromise the VS and VMs.
			    Where possible, the VS should mitigate the results of potential vulnerabilities or malicious content in
			    third-party code on which it relies. For example, physical device drivers (potentially the Host OS) could 
			    be encapsulated within VMs in order to limit the effects of compromise.

                        The VS is designed to provide the appearance of exclusivity to the VMs and is designed
			    to separate or isolate their functions except where specifically shared. Failure of security mechanisms
			    could lead to unauthorized intrusion into or modification of the VMM, or bypass of the VMM altogether,
			    by non-TOE software, such as that running in Guest or Helper VMs or on the host platform. 
			    This must be prevented to avoid compromising the VS.

                        The VS must be capable of protecting the platform from threats that originate within VMs and operational
			    networks connected to the VS. The hosting of untrusted—even malicious—domains by the VS cannot be 
			    permitted to compromise the security and integrity of the platform on which the VS executes. If an 
			    attacker can access the underlying platform in a manner not controlled by the VMM, the attacker might 
			    be able to modify system firmware or software—compromising both the VS and the 
			    underlying platform.

                        Functions performed by the management layer include VM configuration, virtualized network configuration, 
			    allocation of physical resources, and reporting. Only certain authorized system users (administrators) 
			    are allowed to exercise management functions.<br/><br/>
                        Virtualization Systems are often managed remotely over communication networks. Members of these networks can
			    be both geographically and logically separated from each other, and pass through a variety of other 
			    systems which may be under the control of an adversary, and offer the opportunity for communications to be
			    compromised. An adversary with access to an open management network could inject commands into the
			    management infrastructure. This would provide an adversary with administrator privilege on the platform,
			    and administrative control over the VMs and virtual network connections. The adversary could also gain
			    access to the management network by hijacking the management network channel.

                        To the extent that VMs appear isolated within the VS, a threat of weak cryptography may 
			    arise if the VMM does not provide good entropy to support security-related features that depend on
			    entropy to implement cryptographic algorithms. For example, a random number generator keeps an estimate
			    of the number of bits of noise in the entropy pool. From this entropy pool random numbers are created.
			    Good random numbers are essential to implementing strong cryptography. Cryptography implemented using
			    poor random numbers can be defeated by a sophisticated adversary. Such defeat can result in the compromise
			    of Guest VM data and credentials, and of VS data and credentials, and can enable anauthorized access 
			    to the VS or VMs.

            <dl><dt class="SO" id="O.VM_ISOLATION">O.VM_ISOLATION</dt><dd>VMs are the fundamental subject of the system. The VMM is 
                        responsible for applying the system security policy (SSP) to the VM and 
                        all resources. As basic functionality, the VMM must support a security policy that mandates 
                        no information transfer between VMs.<br/><br/>
                        The VMM must support the necessary mechanisms to isolate the resources of all 
                        VMs. The VMM partitions a platform's physical resources for use by the 
                        supported virtual environments. Depending on customer requirements, a VM may need a completely 
                        isolated environment with exclusive access to system resources, or share some of its resources with other 
                        VMs. It must be possible to enforce a security policy that prohibits the transfer of data 
                        between VMs through shared devices. When the platform security policy allows the sharing of 
                        resources across VM boundaries, the VMM must ensure that all access to 
                        those resources is consistent with the policy. The VMM may delegate the responsibility for 
                        the mediation of sharing of particular resources to select Service VMs; however in doing so, 
                        it remains responsible for mediating access to the Service VMs, and each Service 
                        VM must mediate all access to any shared resource that has been delegated to it in 
                        accordance with the SSP.<br/><br/>
                        Devices, whether virtual or physical, are resources requiring access control. The VMM must 
                        enforce access control in accordance to system security policy. Physical devices are platform devices with 
                        access mediated via the VMM per the O.VMM_Integrity objective. Virtual devices may include 
                        virtual storage devices and virtual network devices. Some of the access control restrictions must be enforced
                        internal to Service VMs, as may be the case for isolating virtual networks. 
                        VMMs may also expose purely virtual interfaces. These are VMM specific, 
                        and while they are not analogous to a physical device, they are also subject to access control.<br/><br/>
                        The VMM must support the mechanisms to isolate all resources associated with virtual 
                        networks and to limit a VM's access to only those virtual networks for which it has been 
                        configured. The VMM must also support the mechanisms to control the configurations of 
                        virtual networks according to the SSP.

                        integrity of each VMM component must be established and maintained. This objective concerns 
                        only the integrity of the VS—not the integrity of software running inside of Guest 
                        VMs or of the physical platform. The overall objective is to ensure the integrity of 
                        critical components of a VS.<br/><br/>
                        Initial integrity of a VS can be established through mechanisms such as a digitally signed installation or 
                        update package, or through integrity measurements made at launch. Integrity is maintained in a running system 
                        by careful protection of the VMM from untrusted users and software. For example, it must not
                        be possible for software running within a Guest VM to exploit a vulnerability in a device or
                        hypercall interface and gain control of the VMM. The vendor must release patches for 
                        vulnerabilities as soon as practicable after discovery.

                        capable of undermining the integrity of the platform.

                        (administrators) are allowed to exercise management functions.<br/><br/>
                        Because of the privileges exercised by the VMM management functions, it must not be possible 
                        for the VMM’s management components to be compromised without administrator notification. 
                        This means that unauthorized users cannot be permitted access to the management functions, and the management 
                        components must not be interfered with by Guest VMs or unprivileged users on other 
                        networks—including operational networks connected to the TOE.<br/><br/> VMMs include a set of management functions that collectively allow administrators 
                        to configure and manage the VMM, as well as configure Guest VMs. These 
                        management functions are specific to the VS, distinct from any other management functions 
                        that might exist for the internal management of any given Guest VM. These 
                        VMM management functions are privileged, with the security of the entire system relying on 
                        their proper use. The VMM management functions can be classified into different categories 
                        and the policy for their use and the impact to security may vary accordingly.<br/><br/>
                        The management functions might be distributed throughout the VMM (within the 
                        VMM and Service VMs). The VMM must support the necessary 
                        mechanisms to enable the control of all management functions according to the system security policy. When a 
                        management function is distributed among multiple Service VMs, the VMs 
                        must be protected using the security mechanisms of the Hypervisor and any Service VMs 
                        involved to ensure that the intent of the system security policy is not compromised. Additionally, since 
                        hypercalls permit Guest VMs to invoke the Hypervisor, and often allow the passing of data 
                        to the Hypervisor, it is important that the hypercall interface is well-guarded and that all parameters be 
                        validated.<br/><br/> The VMM maintains configuration data for every 
                        VM on the system. This configuration data, whether of Service or Guest VMs,
                        must be protected. The mechanisms used to establish, modify and verify configuration data are part of the VS 
                        management functions and must be protected as such. The proper internal configuration of Service 
                        VMs that provide critical security functions can also greatly impact VS security. These 
                        configurations must also be protected. Internal configuration of Guest VMs should not 
                        impact overall VS security. The overall goal is to ensure that the VMM, including the 
                        environments internal to Service VMs, is properly configured and that all Guest 
                        VM configurations are maintained consistent with the system security policy throughout 
                        their lifecycle.<br/><br/> Virtualization Systems are often managed remotely. For 
                        example, an administrator can remotely update virtualization software, start and shut down 
                        VMs, and manage virtualized network connections. If a console is required, it could be 
                        run on a separate machine or it could itself run in a VM. When performing remote management, 
                        an administrator must communicate with a privileged management agent over a network. Communications with the 
                        management infrastructure must be protected from Guest VMs and operational networks.

	<h1 id="Security_Requirements" class="indexable,h1" data-level="1">5 Security Requirements</h1>
      This chapter describes the security requirements which have to be fulfilled by the product under evaluation.
     Those requirements comprise functional components from Part 2 and assurance components from Part 3 of 
       <a href="#bibCC">[CC]</a>.
       
    The following conventions are used for the completion of operations:
     <ul>
       <li>
         <b>Refinement</b> operation (denoted by <b>bold text</b> or <strike>strikethrough
         text</strike>): is used to add details to a requirement (including replacing an assignment
         with a more restrictive selection) or to remove part of the requirement that is made irrelevant
         through the completion of another operation, and thus further restricts a requirement.
         </li>
       <li>
         <b>Selection</b> (denoted by <i>italicized text</i>): is used to select one or more options
         provided by the [CC] in stating a requirement.</li>
       <li>
         <b>Assignment</b> operation (denoted by <span class="assignable-content">italicized text</span>): is used to assign a
         specific value to an unspecified parameter, such as the length of a password. Showing the
         value in square brackets indicates assignment.</li>
       <li>
         <b>Iteration</b> operation: is indicated by appending the SFR name with a slash and unique identifier
            suggesting the purpose of the operation, e.g. "/EXAMPLE1."
       </li>
     </ul>

								<b>Key Establishment Schemes</b><br/><br/>
                                <b>SP800-56A Key Establishment Schemes</b><br/><br/>
                                The evaluator shall verify a TOE's implementation of SP800-56A key agreement schemes using the following 
								Function and Validity tests. These validation tests for each key agreement scheme verify that a TOE has
								implemented the components of the key agreement scheme according to the specifications in the
								Recommendation. These components include the calculation of the DLC primitives (the shared secret
								value Z) and the calculation of the derived keying material (DKM) via the Key Derivation Function 
								(KDF). If key confirmation is supported, the evaluator shall also verify that the components of key
								confirmation have been implemented correctly, using the test procedures described below. This includes
								the parsing of the DKM, the generation of MACdata and the calculation of MACtag.<br/><br/>
                                <i>Function Test</i><br/><br/>
                                The Function test verifies the ability of the to implement the key agreement schemes correctly. To conduct 
								this test, the evaluator shall generate or obtain test vectors from a known good implementation of 
								the TOE supported schemes. For each supported key agreement scheme-key agreement role combination, KDF
								type, and, if supported, key confirmation role- key confirmation type combination, the tester shall 
								generate 10 sets of test vectors. The data set consists of one set of domain parameter values (FFC) or 
								the NIST approved curve (ECC) per 10 sets of public keys. These keys are static, ephemeral or both
								depending on the scheme being tested.<br/><br/>
                                The evaluator shall obtain the DKM, the corresponding TOE’s public keys (static and/or ephemeral), the
								MAC tag(s), and any inputs used in the KDF, such as the Other Information field OI and TOE id fields.<br/><br/>
                                If the TOE does not use a KDF defined in SP 800-56A, the evaluator shall obtain only the public keys 
								and the hashed value of the shared secret.<br/><br/>
                                The evaluator shall verify the correctness of the TSF’s implementation of a given scheme by using a 
								known good implementation to calculate the shared secret value, derive the keying material DKM,
								and compare hashes or MAC tags generated from these values.<br/><br/>
                                If key confirmation is supported, the TSF shall perform the above for each implemented approved MAC 
								algorithm.<br/><br/>
                                <i>Validity Test</i><br/><br/>
                                The Validity test verifies the ability of the TOE to recognize another party’s valid and invalid key 
								agreement results with or without key confirmation. To conduct this test, the evaluator shall 
								obtain a list of the supporting cryptographic functions included in the SP800-56A key agreement
								implementation to determine which errors the TOE should be able to recognize. The evaluator
								generates a set of 24 (FFC) or 30 (ECC) test vectors consisting of data sets including domain
								parameter values or NIST approved curves, the evaluator’s public keys, the TOE’s public/private
								key pairs, MACTag, and any inputs used in the KDF, such as the other info and TOE id fields.<br/><br/>
                                The evaluator shall inject an error in some of the test vectors to test that the TOE recognizes
								invalid key agreement results caused by the following fields being incorrect: the shared secret
								value Z, the DKM, the other information field OI, the data to be MACed, or the generated MACTag.
								If the TOE contains the full or partial (only ECC) public key validation, the evaluator will also 
								individually inject errors in both parties’ static public keys, both parties’ ephemeral public
								keys and the TOE’s static private key to assure the TOE detects errors in the public key 
								validation function and/or the partial key validation function (in ECC only). At least two of the
								test vectors shall remain unmodified and therefore should result in valid key agreement results
								(they should pass).<br/><br/>
                                The TOE shall use these modified test vectors to emulate the key agreement scheme using the 
								corresponding parameters. The evaluator shall compare the TOE’s results with the results using 
								a known good implementation verifying that the TOE detects these errors.<br/><br/>
								<b>SP800-56B Key Establishment Schemes</b><br/><br/>
                                The evaluator shall verify that the TSS describes whether the TOE acts as a sender, a recipient, or 
								both for RSA-based key establishment schemes.<br/><br/>
                                If the TOE acts as a sender, the following assurance activity shall be performed to ensure the proper 
								operation of every TOE supported combination of RSA-based key establishment scheme: <br/><br/>
                               <ul>
                                   <li>To conduct this test, the evaluator shall generate or obtain test vectors from a known good implementation of the
							   TOE supported schemes. For each combination of supported key establishment scheme and its options (with or without 
							   key confirmation if supported, for each supported key confirmation MAC function if key confirmation is supported, 
							   and for each supported mask generation function if KTS-OAEP is supported), the tester shall generate 10 sets of
							   test vectors. Each test vector shall include the RSA public key, the plaintext keying material, any additional input 
							   parameters if applicable, the MacKey and MacTag if key confirmation is incorporated, and the outputted ciphertext.
							   For each test vector, the evaluator shall perform a key establishment encryption operation on the TOE with the same 
							   inputs (in cases where key confirmation is incorporated, the test shall use the MacKey from the test vector instead 
							   of the randomly generated MacKey used in normal operation) and ensure that the outputted ciphertext is equivalent to
							   the ciphertext in the test vector.</li>
                               </ul>
                                If the TOE acts as a receiver, the following assurance activities shall be performed to ensure the 
								proper operation of every TOE supported combination of RSA-based key establishment scheme:<br/><br/>
                                To conduct this test, the evaluator shall generate or obtain test vectors from a known good 
								implementation of the TOE supported schemes. For each combination of supported key establishment
								scheme and its options (with our without key confirmation if supported, for each supported key 
								confirmation MAC function if key confirmation is supported, and for each supported mask generation
								function if KTS-OAEP is supported), the tester shall generate 10 sets of test vectors. Each test 
								vector shall include the RSA private key, the plaintext keying material (KeyData), any additional 
								input parameters if applicable, the MacTag in cases where key confirmation is incorporated, and
								the outputted ciphertext. For each test vector, the evaluator shall perform the key establishment 
								decryption operation on the TOE and ensure that the outputted plaintext keying material (KeyData)
								is equivalent to the plaintext keying material in the test vector. In cases where key confirmation
								is incorporated, the evaluator shall perform the key confirmation steps and ensure that the 
								outputted MacTag is equivalent to the MacTag in the test vector.<br/><br/>
                                The evaluator shall ensure that the TSS describes how the TOE handles decryption errors. In accordance
								with NIST Special Publication 800-56B, the TOE shall not reveal the particular error that 
								occurred, either through the contents of any outputted or logged error message or through timing 
								variations. If KTS-OAEP is supported, the evaluator shall create separate contrived ciphertext
								values that trigger each of the three decryption error checks described in NIST Special 
								Publication 800-56B section 7.2.2.3, ensure that each decryption attempt results in an error, and 
								ensure that any outputted or logged error message is identical for each. If KTS-KEM-KWS is 
								supported, the evaluator shall create separate contrived ciphertext values that trigger each of
								the three decryption error checks described in NIST Special Publication 800-56B section 7.2.3.3, 
								ensure that each decryption attempt results in an error, and ensure that any outputted or
								logged error message is identical for each.

							from volatile memory by unauthorized processes.<br/><br/>
                            The TSF must to destroy or cause to be destroyed all copies of cryptographic keys created and
							managed by the TOE once the keys are no longer needed. This requirement is the same for all instances
							of keys within TOE volatile memory regardless of whether the memory is controlled by TOE manufacturer 
							software or by 3rd party TOE modules. The assurance activities are designed with flexibility to
							address cases where the TOE manufacturer has limited insight into the behavior of 3rd party TOE 
							components.<br/><br/>
							The preferred method for destroying keys in TOE volatile memory is by direct overwrite of the memory
							occupied by the keys. The values used for overwriting can be all zeros, all ones, or any other pattern
							or combination of values significantly different than the value of the key itself such that the keys
							are rendered inaccessible to running processes.<br/><br/>
                            Some implementations may find that direct overwriting of memory is not feasible or possible due to 
							programming language constraints. Many memory- and type-safe languages provide no mechanism for
							programmers to specify that a particular memory location be accessed or written. The value of such
							languages is that it is much harder for a programming error to result in a buffer or heap overflow.
							The downside is that multiple copies of keys might be scattered throughout language-runtime memory. 
							In such cases, the TOE should take whatever actions are feasible to cause the keys to become
							inaccessible—freeing memory, destroying objects, closing applications, programming using the minimum 
							possible scope for variables containing keys.<br/><br/>
                            Likewise, if keys reside in memory within the execution context of a third-party module, then the 
							TOE should take whatever feasible actions it can to cause the keys to be destroyed.<br/><br/>
                            Cryptographic keys in non-TOE volatile memory are not covered by this requirement. This expressly includes 
							keys created and used by Guest VMs. The Guest is responsible for disposing of such keys.

                            The ultimate goal of this element is to ensure that disused cryptographic keys are inaccessible not only
							to components of the running system, but are also unrecoverable through forensic analysis of discarded
							storage media. The element is designed to reflect the fact that the latter may not be wholly practical
							at this time due to the way some storage technologies are implemented (e.g., wear-leveling of flash
							storage).<br/><br/>
                            Key storage areas in non-volatile storage can be overwritten with any value that renders the keys 
							unrecoverable. The value used can be all zeros, all ones, or any other pattern or combination of
							values significantly different than the value of the key itself.<br/><br/>
                            The TSF must destroy all copies of cryptographic keys created and managed by the TOE once the
							keys are no longer needed. Since this is a software-only TOE, the hardware controllers that manage
							non-volatile storage media are necessarily outside the TOE boundary. Thus, the TOE manufacturer is
							likely to have little control over—or insight into—the functioning of these storage devices. The 
							TOE must make a “best-effort” to destroy disused cryptographic keys by invoking the 
							appropriate platform interfaces—recognizing that the specific actions taken by the platform are out of
							the TOE’s control.<br/><br/>
                            But in cases where the TOE has insight into the non-volatile storage technologies used by the platform, 
							or where the TOE can specify a preference or method for destroying keys, the destruction should be
							executed by a single, direct overwrite consisting of pseudo-random data or a new key, by a repeating 
							pattern of any static value, or by a block erase.<br/><br/>
                            For keys stored on encrypted media, it is sufficient for the media encryption keys to be destroyed for 
							all keys stored on the media to be considered destroyed.

                                For each key clearing situation the evaluator shall perform one of the following activities:<br/><br/>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>The evaluator shall use appropriate combinations of specialized operational or development 
									environments, development tools (debuggers, emulators, simulators, etc.), or instrumented
									builds (developmental, debug, or release) to demonstrate that keys are cleared correctly,
									including all intermediate copies of the key that may have been created internally by the
									TOE during normal cryptographic processing.</li>
                                    <li>In cases where testing reveals that 3rd-party software modules or programming language
									run-time environments do not properly overwrite keys, this fact must be documented. 
									Likewise, it must be documented if there is no practical way to determine whether such
									modules or environments destroy keys properly.</li>
                                    <li>In cases where it is impossible or impracticable to perform the above tests, the evaluator shall describe how keys are destroyed in such cases, to include:
                                        <ul>
                                            <li>Which keys are affected</li>
                                            <li>The reasons why testing is impossible or impracticable</li>
                                            <li>Evidence that keys are destroyed appropriately (e.g., citations to component documentation, component developer/vendor attestation, component vendor test results)</li>
                                            <li>Aggravating and mitigating factors that may affect the timeliness or execution of key destruction (e.g., caching, garbage collection, operating system memory management)</li>
                                        </ul>
                                        </li>
                                </ul>
                                Use of debug or instrumented builds of the TOE and TOE components is permitted in order to 
								demonstrate that the TOE takes appropriate action to destroy keys. These builds should be 
								based on the same source code as are release builds (of course, with instrumentation
								and debug-specific code added).

                                <b>AES-CBC Known Answer Tests</b><br/><br/>
                                There are four Known Answer Tests (KATs), described below. In all KATs, the plaintext, ciphertext,
								and IV values shall be 128-bit blocks. The results from each test may either be obtained by the 
								evaluator directly or by supplying the inputs to the implementer and receiving the results in 
								response. To determine correctness, the evaluator shall compare the resulting values to those 
								obtained by submitting the same inputs to a known good implementation.
                                <br/><br/>
                                <b>KAT-1.</b>To test the encrypt functionality of AES-CBC, the evaluator shall supply a set of 10
								plaintext values and obtain the ciphertext value that results from AES-CBC encryption of the 
								given plaintext using a key value of all zeros and an IV of all zeros. Five plaintext values shall 
								be encrypted with a 128-bit all-zeros key, and the other five shall be encrypted with a 256-bit
								all-zeros key.
                                <br/><br/>
                                To test the decrypt functionality of AES-CBC, the evaluator shall perform the same test as for encrypt,
								using 10 ciphertext values as input and AES-CBC decryption.
                                <br/><br/>
                                <b>KAT-2.</b>To test the encrypt functionality of AES-CBC, the evaluator shall supply a set of 10
								key values and obtain the ciphertext value that results from AES-CBC encryption of an all-zeros
								plaintext using the given key value and an IV of all zeros. Five of the keys shall be 128-bit keys,
								and the other five shall be 256-bit keys.<br/><br/>
								To test the decrypt functionality of AES-CBC, the evaluator shall perform the same test as for
								encrypt, using an all-zero ciphertext value as input and AES-CBC decryption.<br/><br/>
                                <b>KAT-3.</b>To test the encrypt functionality of AES-CBC, the evaluator shall supply the two sets
								of key values described below and obtain the ciphertext value that results from AES encryption of
								an all-zeros plaintext using the given key value and an IV of all zeros. The first set of keys
								shall have 128 128-bit keys, and the second set shall have 256 256-bit keys. Key i in each set 
								shall have the leftmost i bits be ones and the rightmost N-i bits be zeros, for i in [1,N].<br/><br/>
                                To test the decrypt functionality of AES-CBC, the evaluator shall supply the two sets of key and
								ciphertext value pairs described below and obtain the plaintext value that results from AES-CBC
								decryption of the given ciphertext using the given key and an IV of all zeros. The first set of
								key/ciphertext pairs shall have 128 128-bit key/ciphertext pairs, and the second set of 
								key/ciphertext pairs shall have 256 256-bit key/ciphertext pairs. Key i in each set shall have 
								the leftmost i bits be ones and the rightmost N-i bits be zeros, for i in [1,N]. The ciphertext
								value in each pair shall be the value that results in an all-zeros plaintext when decrypted with
								its corresponding key.<br/><br/>
                                <b>KAT-4.</b>To test the encrypt functionality of AES-CBC, the evaluator shall supply the set of
								128 plaintext values described below and obtain the two ciphertext values that result from AES-CBC
								encryption of the given plaintext using a 128-bit key value of all zeros with an IV of all zeros 
								and using a 256-bit key value of all zeros with an IV of all zeros, respectively. Plaintext value
								i in each set shall have the leftmost i bits be ones and the rightmost 128-i bits be zeros, for i
								in [1,128].<br/><br/>
                                To test the decrypt functionality of AES-CBC, the evaluator shall perform the same test as for
								encrypt, using ciphertext values of the same form as the plaintext in the encrypt test as input
								and AES-CBC decryption.<br/><br/>
								<b>AES-CBC Multi-Block Message Test
                                </b><br/><br/>
                                The evaluator shall test the encrypt functionality by encrypting an i-block message
                                where 1 &lt; i ࣘ 10 . The evaluator shall choose a key, an IV and plaintext
								message of length i blocks and encrypt the message, using the mode to be tested, with the chosen
								key and IV. The ciphertext shall be compared to the result of encrypting the same plaintext message
								with the same key and IV using a known good implementation.<br/><br/>
                                The evaluator shall also test the decrypt functionality for each mode by decrypting an
                                i-block message where 1 &lt; i ࣘ 10 . The evaluator shall choose a key,
								an IV and a ciphertext message of length i blocks and decrypt the message, using the mode to be
								tested, with the chosen key and IV. The plaintext shall be compared to the result of decrypting
								the same ciphertext message with the same key and IV using a known good implementation.<br/><br/>
								<b>AES-CBC Monte Carlo Tests</b><br/><br/>
                                The evaluator shall test the encrypt functionality using a set of 200 plaintext, IV, and key 3-tuples.
								100 of these shall use 128 bit keys, and 100 shall use 256 bit keys. The plaintext and IV values
								shall be 128-bit blocks. For each 3-tuple, 1000 iterations shall be run as follows:<br/><br/>
                                
                                <pre>
                                    # Input: PT, IV, Key
                                    for i = 1 to 1000:
                                        if i == 1:
                                            CT[1] = AES-CBC-Encrypt(Key, IV, PT)
                                            PT = IV
                                        else:
                                            CT[i] = AES-CBC-Encrypt(Key, PT)
                                            PT = CT[i-1]
                                </pre>
                                
                                The ciphertext computed in the 1000th iteration (i.e., CT[1000]) is the result for that trial. This 
								result shall be compared to the result of running 1000 iterations with the same values using a
								known good implementation.<br/><br/>
											The evaluator shall test the decrypt functionality using the same test as for encrypt, exchanging CT
								and PT and replacing AES-CBC-Encrypt with AES-CBC-Decrypt.<br/><br/>
								<b><u>AES-CCM Tests</u></b><br/><br/>
                                The evaluator shall test the generation-encryption and decryption-verification functionality of

                                <b>128 bit and 256 bit keys</b><br/><br/>
                                <b>Two payload lengths.</b>One payload length shall be the shortest supported payload length,
								greater than or equal to zero bytes. The other payload length shall be the longest supported
								payload length, less than or equal to 32 bytes (256 bits).<br/><br/>
								<b>Two or three associated data lengths.</b>One associated data length shall be 0, if supported. 
								One associated data length shall be the shortest supported payload length, greater than or equal
								to zero bytes. One associated data length shall be the longest supported payload length, less
								than or equal to 32 bytes (256 bits). If the implementation supports an associated data length
								of
                                2<sup>16</sup> bytes,
                                an associated data length of 2<sup>16</sup> bytes shall be tested.<br/><br/>
                                <b>Nonce lengths.</b>All supported nonce lengths between 7 and 13 bytes,
                                inclusive, shall be tested.<br/><br/>
                                <b>Tag lengths.</b>All supported tag lengths of 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14 and 16 bytes
                                shall be tested.<br/><br/>
                                To test the generation-encryption functionality of AES-CCM, the evaluator shall perform
                                the following four tests:<br/><br/>
                                <ul>
                                    <li><b>Test 1: </b>For EACH supported key and associated data length and ANY supported payload, nonce and tag

                                    <li><b>Test 2: </b>For EACH supported key and payload length and ANY supported associated data, nonce and tag
										length, the evaluator shall supply one key value, one nonce value and 10 pairs of

                                    <li><b>Test 4: </b>For EACH supported key and tag length and ANY supported associated data, payload and nonce

                                </ul>
                                To determine correctness in each of the above tests, the evaluator shall compare the ciphertext with 
								the result of generation-encryption of the same inputs with a known good implementation.<br/><br/>
                                To test the decryption-verification functionality of AES-CCM, for EACH combination of supported 
								associated data length, payload length, nonce length and tag length, the evaluator shall supply
								a key value and 15 nonce, associated data and ciphertext 3-tuples and obtain either a FAIL result
								or a PASS result with the decrypted payload. The evaluator shall supply 10 tuples that should FAIL
								and 5 that should PASS per set of 15.<br/><br/>
                                Additionally, the evaluator shall use tests from the IEEE 802.11-02/362r6 document “Proposed Test
								vectors for IEEE 802.11 TGi”, dated September 10, 2002, Section 2.1 AES-CCMP Encapsulation

								<b><u>AES-GCM Test</u></b><br/><br/>
                                The evaluator shall test the authenticated encrypt functionality of AES-GCM for each combination of 
								the following input parameter lengths:<br/><br/>
                                <b>128 bit and 256 bit keys</b><br/><br/>
                                <b>Two plaintext lengths.</b>One of the plaintext lengths shall be a non-zero integer multiple

								<br/><br/>
                                <b>Three AAD lengths.</b>One AAD length shall be 0, if supported. One AAD length shall be a

								tuples for each combination of parameter lengths above and obtain the ciphertext value and tag 
								that results from AES-GCM authenticated encrypt. Each supported tag length shall be tested at
								least once per set of 10. The IV value may be supplied by the evaluator or the implementation 
								being tested, as long as it is known.<br/><br/>
                                The evaluator shall test the decrypt functionality using a set of 10 key, ciphertext, tag, AAD, and
								IV 5-tuples for each combination of parameter lengths above and obtain a Pass/Fail result on
								authentication and the decrypted plaintext if Pass. The set shall include five tuples that Pass 
								and five that Fail.<br/><br/>
								The results from each test may either be obtained by the evaluator directly or by supplying the

								smaller.
                                </ul><br/><br/>
                                using a set of 100 (key, plaintext and 128-bit random tweak value) 3-tuples and obtain the ciphertext
								that results from XTS-AES encrypt.<br/><br/>
                                The evaluator may supply a data unit sequence number instead of the tweak value if the implementation
								supports it. The data unit sequence number is a base-10 number ranging between 0 and 255 that
								implementations convert to a tweak value internally.<br/><br/>
                                The evaluator shall test the decrypt functionality of XTS-AES using the same test as for encrypt,
								replacing plaintext values with ciphertext values and XTS-AES encrypt with XTS-AES decrypt.

				              Known Answer Tests (KATs)
					      <p></p>
					      There are four Known Answer Tests (KATs) described below.  For all KATs, the plaintext,
					      initialization vector (IV), and ciphertext values shall be 128-bit blocks.  The results from each test may
					      either be obtained by the validator directly or by supplying the inputs to the implementer
					      and receiving the results in response.  To determine correctness, the evaluator shall
					      compare the resulting values to those obtained by submitting the same inputs to a known
					      good implementation.
				              <p></p>
					      <b>Test 1a:</b> To test the encrypt functionality, the evaluator shall supply a set of 10 plaintext 
					      values and obtain the ciphertext value that results from encryption of the given plaintext
					      using a key value of all zeros and an IV of all zeros.  Five plaintext values shall be encrypted
					      with a 128-bit all zeros key, and the other five shall be encrypted with a 256-bit all zeros key. 
					      To test the decrypt functionality, the evaluator shall perform the same 
					      test as for encrypt, using 10 ciphertext values as input.

					      using the given key value and an IV of all zeros.  Five of the key values shall be 128-bit

					      <b>Test 1c:</b> To test the encrypt functionality, the evaluator shall supply the two sets of key values
					      described below and obtain the ciphertext values that result from AES encryption of an
					      all zeros plaintext using the given key values and an IV of all zeros.  The first set of

					      each set shall have the leftmost i bits be ones and the rightmost N-i bits be zeros,

					      that results in an all zeros plaintext when decrypted with its corresponding key.
					      <p></p>
					      <b>Test 1d:</b> To test the encrypt functionality, the evaluator shall supply the set of
					      128 plaintext values described below and obtain the two ciphertext values that
					      result from encryption of the given plaintext using a 128-bit key value of all
					      zeros and using a 256 bit key value of all zeros, respectively, and an IV of all
					      zeros. Plaintext value i in each set shall have the leftmost bits be ones and
					      the rightmost 128-i bits be zeros, for i in [1, 128].  To test the decrypt functionality,

					    </li>
					    <li><b>Test 2: </b>
					      Multi-Block Message Test
					      <p></p>
					      The evaluator shall test the encrypt functionality by encrypting an i-block 
					      message where 1 less-than i less-than-or-equal to 10. For each i the evaluator 
					      shall choose a key, IV, and plaintext message of length i blocks and encrypt
					      the message, using the mode to be tested, with the chosen key. The ciphertext
					      shall be compared to the result of encrypting the same plaintext message with
					      the same key and IV using a known good implementation. The evaluator shall also 
					      test the decrypt functionality by decrypting an i-block message where 1 less-than
					      i less-than-or-equal to 10. For each i the evaluator shall choose a key and
					      a ciphertext message of length i blocks and decrypt the message, using the mode 
					      to be tested, with the chosen key. The plaintext shall be compared to the result
					      of decrypting the same ciphertext message with the same key using a known good implementation.
					      <p></p>
					    </li>
					    <li><b>Test 3: </b>
					      Monte-Carlo Test
					      <p></p>
					      For AES-CTR mode perform the Monte Carlo Test for ECB Mode on the encryption 
					      engine of the counter mode implementation. There is no need to test the decryption engine.
					      <p></p>
					      The evaluator shall test the encrypt functionality using 200 plaintext/key pairs. 
					      100 of these shall use 128 bit keys, and 100 of these shall use 256 bit keys.  
					      The plaintext values shall be 128-bit blocks.  For each pair, 1000 iterations shall be run as follows:
					      <p></p>
					      For AES-ECB mode<br/>
					      # Input: PT, Key<br/>
					      for i = 1 to 1000:<br/>
					      CT[i] = AES-ECB-Encrypt(Key, PT)<br/>
					      PT = CT[i]
					      <p></p>
					      The ciphertext computed in the 1000th iteration is the result for that 
					      trial.  This result shall be compared to the result of running 1000 
					      iterations with the same values using a known good implementation.  
					    </li>
					  </ul>
					    If "invoke platform-provided" is selected, the evaluator confirms that SSH connections are only successful if appropriate algorithms and appropriate key sizes are configured. To do this, the evaluator shall perform the following tests:
					    <ul>
					      <li><b>Test 1: </b>
						[Conditional: TOE is an SSH server] The evaluator shall configure an SSH client to connect with an invalid cryptographic algorithm and key size for each listening SSH socket connection on the TOE.  
						The evaluator initiates SSH client connections to each listening SSH socket connection on the TOE and observes that the connection fails in each attempt.
					      </li>
					    <li><b>Test 2: </b>
					      [Conditional: TOE is an SSH client] The evaluator shall configure a listening SSH socket on a remote SSH server that accepts only invalid cryptographic algorithms and keys. 
					      The evaluator uses the TOE to attempt an SSH connection to this server and observes that the connection fails.

								The TSF hashing functions can be implemented with one of two orientations. The first is a bit-oriented
								mode that hashes messages of arbitrary length. The second is a byte-oriented mode that hashes messages 
								that are an integral number of bytes in length (i.e., the length (in bits) of the message to be
								hashed is divisible by 8). Separate tests for each orientation are given below. <br/><br/>
								The evaluator shall perform all of the following tests for each hash algorithm and orientation

								The evaluators devise an input set consisting of 100 long messages ranging in size from 
								rate+(rate+1) to rate+(100*(rate+1)), incrementing by rate+1. (For example, SHA-3-256 has a rate
								of 1088 bits. Therefore, 100 messages will be generated with lengths 2177, 3266, …, 109988 bits.)
								The message text shall be pseudo-randomly generated. The evaluators compute the message digest for
								each of the messages and ensure that the correct result is produced when the messages are provided
								to the TSF.<br/><br/><br/>
								<b>Selected Long Messages Test, Byte-oriented Mode</b><br/><br/>
								The evaluators devise an input set consisting of 100 messages ranging in size from (rate+(rate+8))
								to (rate+100*(rate+8)), incrementing by rate+8. (For example, SHA-3-256 has a rate of 1088 bits.
								Therefore 100 messages will be generated of lengths 2184, 3280, 4376, …, 110688 bits.) The message
								text shall be pseudo-randomly generated. The evaluators compute the message digest for each of the
								messages and ensure that the correct result is produced when the messages are provided to the TSF.<br/><br/><br/>
								<b>Pseudo-randomly Generated Messages Monte Carlo) Test, Byte-oriented Mode</b><br/><br/>
								The evaluators supply a seed of d bits (where d is the length of the message digest produced by
								the hash function to be tested. This seed is used by a pseudorandom function to generate 100,000 
								message digests. One hundred of the digests (every 1000th digest) are recorded as checkpoints. The
								TOE then uses the same procedure to generate the same 100,000 message digests and 100 checkpoint
								values. The evaluators then compare the results generated ensure that the correct result is
								produced when the messages are generated by the TSF.<br/><br/>

                            This requirement ensures that sufficient entropy is available to any VM that requires it. The entropy 
							need not provide high-quality entropy for every possible method that a VM might acquire it. The VMM
							must, however, provide some means for VMs to get sufficient entropy. For example, the VMM can
							provide an interface that returns entropy to a Guest VM. Alternatively, the VMM could provide 
							pass-through access to entropy sources provided by the host platform.<br/><br/>
                            This requirement allows for three general ways of providing entropy to guests: 1) The VS can provide a 
							Hypercall accessible to VM-aware guests, 2) access to a virtualized device that provides entropy, or 
							3) pass-through access to a hardware entropy source (including a source of random numbers). In all 
							cases, it is possible that the guest is made VM-aware through installation of software or drivers.
							For the second and third cases, it is possible that the guest could be VM-unaware. There is no
							requirement that the TOE provide entropy sources as expected by VM-unaware guests. That is, the TOE
							does not have to anticipate every way a guest might try to acquire entropy as long as it supplies a
							mechanism that can be used by VM-aware guests, or provides access to a standard mechanism that a 
							VM-unaware guest would use.<br/><br/>
                            The ST author should select “Hypercall interface” if the TSF provides an API function through which 
							guest-resident software can obtain entropy or random numbers. The ST author should select 
							“virtual device interface” if the TSF presents a virtual device interface to the Guest OS through
							which it can obtain entropy or random numbers. Such an interface could present a virtualized real
							device, such as a TPM, that can be accessed by VM-unaware guests, or a virtualized fictional device
							that would require the Guest OS to be VM-aware. The ST author should select “passthrough access to 
							hardware entropy source” if the TSF permits Guest VMs to have direct access to hardware entropy or
							random number source on the platform. The ST author should select all items that are appropriate.<br/><br/>
                            For <a href="#FCS_ENT_EXT.1.2">FCS_ENT_EXT.1.2</a>, the VMM must ensure that the provision of entropy to one VM cannot affect the quality

				the real world, such as the time of day or the underlying hardware of the host system. A hypercall 
				could also be used to transfer data between VMs through a copy-paste mechanism. Because hypercall 
				interfaces expose the VMM to Guest VMs, these interfaces constitute attack surface. In order to
				minimize attack surface, these interfaces must be limited to the minimum needed to support VM 
				functionality.<br/><br/>

                            A vendor-provided test harness may reduce evaluation time.<br/><br/>
                            There is no expectation that the evaluator will need to review source code in order to accomplish the
                            Assurance Activity.  The evaluator documentation review should ensure that there are documented
                            Hypercall functions in the TSS, that each documented Hypercall function contains the specified
                            information, and that there are not obvious or publicly known Hypercall functions missing.

                            The purpose of these requirements is to ensure that VMs are not given inadvertent access to information 
				from different domains because of media or removable media devices left connected to physical machines.<br/><br/>
                            Removable media is media that can be ejected from a device, such as a compact disc, floppy disk, SD, or
				compact flash memory card.<br/><br/>
                            Removable media devices are removable devices that include media, such as USB flash drives and USB hard
				drives. Removable media devices can themselves contain removable media (e.g., USB CDROM drives).<br/><br/>
                            For purposes of this requirement, an Information Domain is:
                            <ol type="a">
                                <li>A VM or collection of VMs</li>
                                <li>The Virtualization System</li>
                                <li>Host OS</li>
                                <li>Management Subsystem</li>
                            </ol>
                            These requirements also apply to virtualized removable media—such as virtual CD drives that connect to
				ISO images—as well as physical media—such as CDROMs and USB flash drives. In the case of virtual
				CDROMs, virtual ejection of the virtual media is sufficient.<br/><br/>
                            In the first assignment, the ST author lists all removable media and removable media devices (both virtual
				and real) that are supported by the TOE. The ST author then
				selects actions that are appropriate for all removable media and removable media devices (both 
				virtual and real) that are being claimed in the assignment.<br/><br/>
                            For clarity, the ST author may iterate this requirement so that like actions are grouped with the 
				removable media or devices to which they apply (e.g., the first iteration could contain all devices
				for which media is ejected on a switch; the second iteration could contain all devices for which 
				access is prevented on switch, etc.).

                            “Update” in the context of this SFR refers to the process of replacing a non-volatile, system resident
				software component with another. The former is referred to as the NV image, and the latter is the
				update image. While the update image is typically newer than the NV image, this is not a requirement.
				There are legitimate cases where the system owner may want to rollback a component to an older version
				(e.g., when the component manufacturer releases a faulty update, or when the system relies on an 
				undocumented feature no longer present in the update). Likewise, the owner may want to update with the
				same version as the NV image to recover from faulty storage.<br/><br/>
                            All discrete software components (e.g., applications, drivers, kernel, firmware) of the TSF, should be 
				digitally signed by the corresponding manufacturer and subsequently verified by the mechanism
				performing the update. Since it is recognized that components may be signed by different manufacturers,
				it is essential that the update process verify that both the update and NV images were produced by the 
				same manufacturer (e.g., by comparing public keys) or signed by legitimate signing keys (e.g.,
				successful verification of certificates when using X.509 certificates).<br/><br/>
                            The Digital Signature option is the preferred mechanism for authenticating updates. The Published Hash
				option will be removed from a future version of this PP.

                                update mechanisms for updating the system software. Updates to the TOE either have a

        <h2 id="s-sar" class="indexable,h2" data-level="2">5.2 Security Assurance Requirements</h2>
            The Security Objectives for the TOE in Section 4 were constructed to address threats identified in Section 3.1. The 
		Security Functional Requirements (SFRs) in Section 5.1 are a formal instantiation of the Security Objectives. The PP
		identifies the Security Assurance Requirements (SARs) to frame the extent to which the evaluator assesses the
		documentation applicable for the evaluation and performs independent testing.<br/><br/>
            This section lists the set of Security Assurance Requirements (SARs) from Part 3 of the Common Criteria for Information 
		Technology Security Evaluation, Version 3.1, Revision 4 that are required in evaluations against this PP. Individual
		assurance activities to be performed are specified in both Section 5.1 as well as in this section.<br/><br/>
            After the ST has been approved for evaluation, the Information Technology Security Evaluation Facility (ITSEF) will obtain
		the TOE, supporting environmental IT, and the administrative/user guides for the TOE. The ITSEF is expected to perform
		actions mandated by the CEM for the ASE and ALC SARs. The ITSEF also performs the assurance activities contained 
		within Section 5, which are intended to be an interpretation of the other CEM assurance requirements as they apply 
		to the specific technology instantiated in the TOE. The assurance activities that are captured in Section 5 also 
		provide clarification as to what the developer needs to provide to demonstrate the TOE is compliant with the PP.

				    evaluators must document in the test plan that each applicable testing requirement in the 
				    ST is covered.<br/><br/>
                                The Test Plan identifies the platforms to be tested, and for those platforms not included in the test
				    plan but included in the ST, the test plan provides a justification for not
				    testing the platforms. This justification must address the differences between the tested platforms
				    and the untested platforms, and make an argument that the differences do not affect the testing to
				    be performed. It is not sufficient to merely assert that the differences have no affect; rationale
				    must be provided. If all platforms claimed in the ST are tested, then no 
				    rationale is necessary.<br/><br/>
                                The test plan describes the composition of each platform to be tested, and any setup that is necessary
				    beyond what is contained in the AGD documentation. It should be noted that the evaluators are
				    expected to follow the AGD documentation for installation and setup of each platform either as
				    part of a test or as a standard pre-test condition. This may include special test drivers or
				    tools. For each driver or tool, an argument (not just an assertion) is provided that the driver or 
				    tool will not adversely affect the performance of the functionality by the TOE and its platform.
				    This also includes the configuration of cryptographic engines to be used. The cryptographic

                                The test plan identifies high-level test objectives as well as the test procedures to be followed to 
				    achieve those objectives. These procedures include expected results. The test report (which could
				    just be an annotated version of the test plan) details the activities that took place when the
				    test procedures were executed, and includes the actual results of the tests. This shall be a 
				    cumulative account, so if there was a test run that resulted in a failure; a fix installed; and
				    then a successful re-run of the test, the report would show a “fail” and “pass” result (and the

    However, applied modules, packages and/or use cases may refine specific requirements as mandatory. <br/><br/>

   The first type (<a href="#optional-reqs" class="dynref"> A.1 Strictly Optional  Requirements
    </a>) are strictly optional requirements that are independent of the
	  TOE implementing any function.
   If the TOE fulfills any of these requirements or supports a certain functionality, the vendor is encouraged to included the SFRs
	  in the ST, but are not required in order to conform to this PP.<br/><br/>

  The second type (<a href="#objective-reqs" class="dynref"> </a>) are objective requirements that describe security functionality not yet 
	  widely available in commercial technology.
   The requirements are not currently mandated in the body of this PP, but will be included in
	  the baseline requirements in future versions of this PP. Adoption by vendors is
	  encouraged and expected as soon as possible.<br/><br/>

  The third type (<a href="#feat-based-reqs" class="dynref"> </a>) 
are dependent on the TOE implementing a particular function.
If the TOE fulfills any of these requirements, the vendor must either add the related SFR or disable the functionality for the
	  evaluated configuration.
