		This document describes a core set of high-level fundamental 
		security requirements expected of any Software Defined Networking
		(SDN) Controller for use in an enterprise. It is intended to 
		provide a minimal, baseline set of requirements which can be built
		upon by future revisions to provide an overall set of security 
		solutions for an enterprise network.
		<p xmlns="http://common-criteria.rhcloud.com/ns/esr"></p>
		SDN Controllers are one of many components of an SDN networking 
		architecture. See below diagram.

      SDN Controller in relation to the SDN Planes</div>
		<p xmlns="http://common-criteria.rhcloud.com/ns/esr"></p>
		An SDN Controller is a central and vital component of what 
		constitutes an SDN system and is available as a logical or a 
		physical device. An SDN Controller manages and distributes network
		policies, collects routing and payload information from the Data
		Plane, and interfaces with user applications in the Management
		Plane. Each of the planes in an SDN system is composed of multiple
		logical or physical components. SDN Controllers logically 
		centralize the network intelligence and state in the Control 
		Plane. 
		<p xmlns="http://common-criteria.rhcloud.com/ns/esr"></p>
		For clarity the following definitions are provided:
		<ul xmlns="http://common-criteria.rhcloud.com/ns/esr">
			<li>
				The Control Plane is a logical entity that receives 
				instructions or requirements from the SDN Application 
				layer through its northbound interface and relays them to
				the Data Plane through its southbound interface. The 
				Controller extracts information about the network from 
				the Data Plane and communicates back to the SDN 
				Application Layer with an abstract view of the network,
				including statistics and events about what is happening.
			</li>
			<li>
				The Data Plane (or SDN Network Devices) controls the 
				forwarding and data processing capabilities for the 
				network. This includes forwarding and processing of the
				data path.
			</li>
			<li>
				The Management Plane (or SDN Applications Layer) is 
				composed of programs that communicate behaviors and 
				needed resources with the SDN Controller via application
				programming interfaces (APIs). In addition, the 
				applications can build an abstracted view of the network
				by collecting information from the Controller for 
				decision-making purposes. These applications could 
				include networking management, analytics, or business
				applications used to run large data centers. For example,
				an analytics application might be built to recognize 
				suspicious network activity for security purposes. The 
				Management Plane is sometimes also referred to as the 
				Orchestration Layer.

		The following are the essential security requirements that are

		management functionality is considered to satisfy any security
		requirements that pertain to the secure use of management features.
		<p xmlns="http://common-criteria.rhcloud.com/ns/esr"></p>
		Any other conditional requirements that depend on whether or not
		the product implements a certain capability are listed in the
		“Optional Extensions” section below.
		<ul xmlns="http://common-criteria.rhcloud.com/ns/esr">
			<li>
				The remote administration and audit functions shall use
				cryptography to protect communications.
			</li>
			<li>
				All communications with other SDN components shall be
				protected and authenticated.
			</li>
			<li>
				The SDN Controller shall be capable of auditing 
				administrative actions, including any configuration changes
				and rebooting of the SDN Controller.
			</li>
			<li>
				The SDN Controller shall provide an authentication mechanism
				for local and remote administrators, as well as the 
				device/VM itself (e.g., the device/VM maintains an 
				authentication credential that can be used to authenticate
				it to an administrator’s client) .

			<li>
				The SDN Controller shall provide a cryptographic means to
				validate the source of updates to be installed on the 
				device/VM.

			<li>
				The SDN Controller shall require any default passwords 
				/ other credentials to be changed upon installation.

			<li>
				The SDN Controller shall protect keys, key material, and 
				authentication credentials from unauthorized disclosure.

			<li>
				The SDN Controller shall be robust against malformed 
				network packets, and denial-of-service attacks.
