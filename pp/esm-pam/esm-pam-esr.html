		Certain capabilities on an Enterprise network require an enhanced level of protection. For instance: <ul>
			<li>Access to mission critical or sensitive data</li>
			<li>The ability to manage or bypass network security controls</li>
			<li>The ability to control machines or applications (e.g. Industrial Control Systems).</li> 
		</ul>
		</p>
		<p xmlns="http://common-criteria.rhcloud.com/ns/esr">
		These capabilities are usually restricted to privileged accounts and are protected by restricting access to those accounts.
		</p>
		<p xmlns="http://common-criteria.rhcloud.com/ns/esr">
		A Privileged Access Management solution manages these privileged accounts and associated credentials in order to provide increased granularity of control, 
		improved monitoring of privileged activity, and to reduce the attack surface of the privileged accounts.
		</p>
		<p xmlns="http://common-criteria.rhcloud.com/ns/esr">
		PAM solutions (as defined by Gartner) typically offer one or more of these features:
		<ul>
			<li>Discover, manage and govern privileged accounts (i.e., accounts with superuser/administrator privileges) on multiple systems and applications.</li>
			<li>Control access to privileged accounts, including shared and emergency access.</li>
			<li>Randomize, manage and vault credentials (password, keys, etc.) for administrative, service and application accounts.</li>
			<li>Provide single sign-on (SSO) for privileged access to prevent credentials from being revealed.</li>
			<li>Control, filter and orchestrate privileged commands, actions and tasks.</li>
			<li>Manage and broker credentials to applications, services and devices to avoid exposure.</li>
			<li>Monitor, record, audit and analyze privileged access, sessions and actions.</li>

	<div class="section" id="resourcesprotected">Resources to be protected</div>
		The primary purpose of a PAM solution is to protect the privileged accounts or 
		privileged access mechanisms that are under management by the PAM. To that end, the following resources and functions need to be protected: 
		<ul xmlns="http://common-criteria.rhcloud.com/ns/esr">
			<li>Audit Information (Both PAM functional audit information and Session Monitoring data)</li>
			<li>Credentials to be managed by the PAM (Credentials to access the controlled assets)</li>
			<li>Credentials to access and administer the PAM</li>
			<li>Access Policies to be managed by the PAM. </li>
			<li>Communications to or from the PAM solution. </li>
			<li>Backup and recovery data, and all other resources required to recover the network in the event of a PAM failure.</li>

			The following assumptions are made about attackers' ability to develop attacks: <ul>
				<li>An attacker has an arbitrary amount of time to analyze the behavior of the product, its interaction with its platform, and the data it transmits over the network.</li>
				<li>An attacker is able to acquire their own copy of the target product and study its behavior on a platform that they control.</li>
			</ul>
		</p><p xmlns="http://common-criteria.rhcloud.com/ns/esr">
			The attacker is expected to engage in the following general classes of attack: <ul>
				<li>Network eavesdropping, in which an attacker may monitor and gain access to data exchanged between the product and other endpoints.</li>
				<li>Network attack, in which an attacker may initiate malicious communications with the product or alter communications between the product and other endpoints.</li>
				<li>Local attack, in which an attacker has gained the ability to execute code or instructions on the PAM platform, 
					which may be used to escalate privilege or access data without authorization.</li> 
				<li>Limited physical access attack, in which an attacker may attempt to access data on the system by virtue of being physically present 
					for a limited period of time. This limited physical access does not include attacks in which the attacker could disassemble the system to gain access to its storage media or manipulate the product's underlying hardware and firmware. Systems used for working remotely, such as laptops and tablets, for which an attacker could gain longer physical access to, should apply additional protections that are provided by products evaluated against other Protection Profiles (e.g. FDE cPP).</li>
